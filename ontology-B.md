## McTaggart's article "The unreality of time"
#### 1. Definitions of A-series and B-series. Which of these concepts refer to permanent distinctions? Which are more fundamental? (p. 458).
- The A-series refers to the temporal ordering of events based on their past, present, and future relations, while the B-series refers to the temporal ordering of events based on their before and after relations. The A-series involves permanent distinctions as it relies on the intrinsic properties of events such as being past, present, or future. It is considered more fundamental as it directly involves the experience of time.
#### 2. What is the relation between time and change? Why is an A series necessary for change? How does McTaggart understand the concept of change (in particular, what is the subject of change in his view)? (pp. 459-460).
- Time and change are intimately connected as change implies the passage of time. An A-series is necessary for change because it provides the framework for events to transition from being future to becoming present and then past. McTaggart views change as a property of events, where the subject of change is the event itself undergoing alteration in its temporal properties.
#### 3. What is the C-series? How does it relate to the A- and B-series? Which series have directions and which don't? Can a non-temporal series have a direction? (pp. 462-463).
- The C-series refers to a series of events ordered solely by their temporal relations without reference to past, present, or future. It relates to the A-series by providing a way to order events without the temporal distinctions inherent in the A-series. The A-series has directions (past, present, future), while the B-series and C-series do not inherently have directions. A non-temporal series cannot have a direction because directionality requires temporal relations.
#### 4. Compare all three series (A, B and C) with respect to their relation to time itself and their fundamentality. (pp. 463-464).
- The A-series is intimately related to the experience of time itself and is considered fundamental as it involves the intrinsic properties of events. The B-series is a more abstract way of ordering events based on their temporal relations without reference to the experience of time. The C-series is even more abstract, ordering events solely by their temporal relations, independent of any temporal distinctions.
#### 5. Two objections to the A theory of time. (pp. 465-466).
- Two objections to the A-theory of time are the problem of temporary intrinsic properties (events changing their temporal relations over time) and the problem of simultaneity (events being both past and present simultaneously).
#### 6. If temporal characteristics of the A-series are relations, what objects do they connect? (pp. 467-468).
- If temporal characteristics of the A-series are relations, they connect events to the temporal framework of past, present, and future.
#### 7. Two variants of McTaggart's argument against the reality of time (identify all its relevant premises). Vicious circularity and infinite regress involved in the A series. (pp. 468-469)
- Two variants of McTaggart's argument against the reality of time involve the notions of either vicious circularity (in defining the A-series) or infinite regress (in trying to ground the reality of the A-series).
#### 8. How does McTaggart define tensed forms of the verb "to be"? Is there any alternative to his definition? (p. 468)
- McTaggart defines tensed forms of the verb "to be" as expressions that involve a temporal relation such as "is past," "is present," or "is future." An alternative definition might involve grounding these forms in tenseless propositions or some other metaphysical framework.
#### 9. The experiential source of the division between the past, present and the future. What is a "specious present"? Is it momentary, or does it have a duration? (pp. 471-472)
- The experiential source of the division between past, present, and future is known as the "specious present," which is the psychological moment wherein one's experience of the present occurs. It is debated whether it is momentary or has a duration, with different interpretations existing.
#### 10. Given McTaggart's argument against the consistency of the A-series, can we still believe that the B and C series exist? (pp. 473-474)
- McTaggart's argument against the consistency of the A-series does not necessarily negate the existence of the B and C-series, as they can still provide alternative ways of ordering events temporally. However, it does challenge the traditional understanding of time as experienced through the A-series.

### Smart
#### 1. Which temporal concepts are anthropocentric and which are not? (p. 94)
- Anthropocentric temporal concepts are those that are centered around human experience and perspective, such as the notions of past, present, and future. Non-anthropocentric concepts are those that are independent of human experience, such as the mathematical framework of spacetime in physics.
#### 2. Are physical objects three-dimensional or four-dimensional? What is Smart's interpretation of change according to the 4D-view? (pp. 94-95)
- According to Smart, physical objects are four-dimensional entities extended across time as well as space. Change, in the 4D-view, is interpreted as different temporal parts of an object existing at different times.
#### 3. The proposed analysis of expressions "past", "present" "future" and tensed verbs. The difference between utterances (tokens) and sentences. Self-referential utterances (token-reflexivity). (p. 95)
- Smart proposes analyzing expressions like "past," "present," and "future" as referring to different temporal parts of spacetime. Utterances (tokens) are specific instances of speech acts, while sentences represent linguistic expressions. Self-referential utterances involve referring to themselves within the context of their own utterance.
#### 4. Try to translate the utterance "This event was future" (or "This event will be past") using Smart's translation scheme. Can it be done?
- 4. Translating the utterance "This event was future" into Smart's translation scheme might involve specifying the temporal part of the event in question that corresponds to what would have been considered future from a certain perspective. However, it might be problematic due to the inherent tenselessness of the 4D-view.
#### 5. Do the words "past" "present" "future" have fixed references? (p. 96)####
- In Smart's view, the words "past," "present," and "future" do not have fixed references; rather, they are relative to different temporal perspectives within the 4D framework.
#### 6. Can events "become" or "come into existence"? Why? (p. 96)
- Smart argues against events "becoming" or "coming into existence" in any substantial sense, as these concepts imply a temporal change that is not compatible with the 4D-view's tenseless ontology.
#### 7. The main argument against the objective flow of time. (p. 97)
- The main argument against the objective flow of time, in Smart's view, might involve pointing out the difficulties in establishing a privileged present moment within the framework of spacetime.
#### 8. An argument from relativity against the existence of an objective "now" (p. 97)
- An argument from relativity against the existence of an objective "now" could involve referencing the relativity of simultaneity, which suggests that the notion of a universal present moment is not compatible with the relativistic understanding of spacetime.
#### 9. Sellars' objection: tenseless verbs are definable in terms of tensed ones. The distinction between tenseless and timeless predicates (pp. 98-99).
- Sellars' objection suggests that tenseless verbs can be defined in terms of tensed ones, thereby undermining the need for tense in our understanding of language. The distinction between tenseless and timeless predicates lies in their temporal reference: tenseless predicates refer to properties that are independent of time, while timeless predicates refer to properties that hold at all times.
### Williams
#### 1. What is the theory of manifold? (p. 457)
- The theory of manifold refers to the mathematical structure representing spacetime, wherein each point corresponds to an event in spacetime.
#### 2. What does it mean "to take time seriously"? (p. 458)
- To "take time seriously" means to acknowledge the reality of time as an integral aspect of our existence and to examine its nature and implications seriously.
#### 3. Two main motives for limiting time (temporal dimension) to the present. (p. 459)
- Two main motives for limiting time to the present might include the desire to simplify our understanding of reality and to avoid metaphysical complexities associated with the passage of time.
#### 4. Two types of metaphors of motion used to describe the passage of time. (pp. 461-462)
- Two types of metaphors of motion used to describe the passage of time might include the river metaphor and the locomotive metaphor, both of which suggest a linear progression from past to future.
#### 5. How do we define motion in the four-dimensional manifold? Can there be any motion that is only in time and not in space? (p. 463)
- Motion in the four-dimensional manifold can be defined as changes in an object's position relative to the spacetime coordinates. There can be motion that is only in time and not in space, such as changes in temporal location without accompanying spatial displacement.
#### 6. The regress argument against the passage of time. (pp. 463-464)
- The regress argument against the passage of time suggests that any attempt to explain the passage of time inevitably leads to an infinite regress of explanations, thereby rendering the notion problematic.
#### 7. Is the passage of time necessary in order to introduce the directionality (arrow) of time? (pp. 464-465)
- Whether the passage of time is necessary for introducing the directionality of time depends on one's philosophical stance. Some argue that time's directionality is inherent in its passage, while others suggest alternative explanations.
#### 8. Is it conceivable to switch the temporal dimension of an object with its spatial dimension? What is a completely isotropic theory of space-time? (pp. 468-469)
- It is conceivable to switch the temporal dimension of an object with its spatial dimension within certain theoretical frameworks, such as theories involving higher-dimensional spacetime. A completely isotropic theory of spacetime would posit that spacetime looks the same in all directions and would lack any inherent directionality.

## Sally Haslanger, "Persistence through time" from The Oxford Handbook of Metaphysics, pp. 315-351. The supporting reading is: M. Loux, "Concrete particulars II. Persistence through time" (without the section "A second argument for perdurantism - change in parts"), pp. 230-247.
#### 1. Two main views on how objects persist: endurantism and perdurantism. The third option: exdurantism (the stage theory) and its analogy with the Lewisian modal theory of counterparts.
- Endurantism posits that objects are wholly present at each moment of their existence, while perdurantism suggests that objects persist through time by having temporal parts. Exdurantism, also known as the stage theory, proposes that objects are not enduring entities but rather sequences of temporal stages. This theory is analogous to David Lewis's modal theory of counterparts, where objects are analyzed in terms of their counterpart relations across possible worlds.
#### 2. A comparison of the available positions on persistence with respect to the following questions:
- **Are ordinary particulars three- or four-dimensional?**
- **How should we interpret statements about diachronic identity (identity across time): as genuine identity statements or something else?
- **Do particulars possess temporal parts in addition to spatial parts?
    Endurantism typically aligns with a three-dimensional view of ordinary particulars, interpreting statements about diachronic identity as genuine identity statements, and denying the existence of temporal parts. Perdurantism, on the other hand, usually adopts a four-dimensional view, interpreting statements about diachronic identity as involving a relation between different temporal parts of an object and affirming the existence of temporal parts.
#### 3. Connections between the problem of persistence and the question of the nature of time.
- The nature of time influences how we conceive of object persistence. The A theory posits a dynamic view of time where past, present, and future are distinct, while the B theory suggests a static view where all times are equally real. Eternalism holds that past, present, and future all exist, while presentism contends that only the present exists. Endurantism can be reconciled with eternalism if it allows for temporal parts, while perdurantism aligns more naturally with eternalism due to its four-dimensional ontology. Similarly, endurantism might be reconciled with presentism if it denies the existence of temporal parts, whereas perdurantism is more compatible with eternalism.
#### 4. The problem of qualitative change and how perdurantism solves it.
- Perdurantism addresses the problem of qualitative change by rejecting the presupposition of the persistence condition, which demands that an object maintains its identity despite changing properties. Perdurantism allows for an object to have different temporal parts with different properties, thereby accommodating qualitative change.
#### 5. Endurantism and the problem of change. Relationism. The problem of intrinsic change and temporary intrinsics.
- Endurantism faces challenges in accounting for intrinsic change, especially when considering temporary intrinsics—properties that an object possesses only temporarily. These temporary intrinsics raise questions about the nature of identity over time and whether temporary intrinsics must be monadic properties.
#### 6. Other solutions of the problem of change for endurantism: temporally qualified instantiations, copula-tensing, adverbialism, and SOF-ism.
- Endurantism offers various solutions to the problem of change, including temporally qualified instantiations, where properties are qualified by time, copula-tensing, which modifies the copula to account for temporal relations, adverbialism, which treats tense as an adverbial modifier, and SOF-ism, which interprets statements about change as statements about different instantiation times.
#### 7. The ontology of perdurantism and the existence of arbitrary compositions of spatiotemporally scattered objects.
- Perdurantism allows for the existence of arbitrary compositions of spatiotemporally scattered objects, raising questions about the ontology of familiar objects versus arbitrary aggregates. The "no change" objection suggests that perdurantism implies a lack of genuine change, as objects are merely collections of temporal parts.

##Peter van Inwagen ("The Doctrine of Arbitrary Undetached Parts")
#### 1. Doctrine of Arbitrary Undetached Parts (DAUP)
The DAUP posits that for any object, there are parts of that object that are arbitrarily chosen and yet are not detached from the object. This means that an object could have parts that are not essential to it and can be arbitrarily added or subtracted without changing the identity of the object. This differs from the claim that there are undetached parts of objects, as the latter suggests that there are parts of objects that are necessarily attached to them and cannot be arbitrarily added or subtracted without altering the identity of the object.
#### 2. Mereological Essentialism (ME) and Mereological Near-Essentialism (MNE)
ME asserts that the parts of an object are essential to its identity, meaning that any change in its parts would result in a change in its identity. MNE weakens this claim by suggesting that while some parts may be essential to an object's identity, others may be near-essential, meaning that they can be changed without altering the object's identity. Van Inwagen finds both ME and MNE unacceptable because they entail that an object has a determinate number of parts, which conflicts with the DAUP.
#### 3. Argument Showing DAUP Entails MNE
Van Inwagen presents an argument to demonstrate that the DAUP entails MNE. This argument relies on identity statements derived from the assumption of DAUP, leading to the conclusion that some parts of objects are near-essential. Heller provides justifications for each identity statement by denying one of the 'unpleasant alternatives' (a) – (e), which are potential objections to the premises of the argument.
4. *Skipped.*
#### 5. Doctrine of Arbitrary Temporal Parts (DATP)
The DATP suggests that for any object extended in time, there are temporal parts of that object that are arbitrarily chosen and yet are not detached from the object. Van Inwagen is skeptical about the existence and intelligibility of temporal parts, as he believes that such parts would violate the principle of arbitrary undetached parts. He does not find any temporal parts that could be seen as non-arbitrary.
6. *For those who participated in the last semester class.*
#### 7. Heller's Explanations of Temporal Parts
Heller provides explanations of temporal parts, suggesting that they are analogous to spatial parts and are necessary for understanding the persistence of material bodies through time. However, it is unlikely that these explanations would change van Inwagen's stance, as he maintains a fundamental skepticism regarding the existence of temporal parts and their coherence. The fundamental difference between van Inwagen and Heller regarding persistence in time of material bodies lies in their respective views on the existence and nature of temporal parts.
#### 8. From the Four-Dimensionalist Point of View
For a four-dimensionalist (perdurantist), an object exists now if it has a temporal part that is present at the current moment. There can be distinct objects that coincide spatiotemporally, as they may have different temporal parts. A three-dimensionalist (endurantist) who wants to accept temporal parts would be committed to distinct objects that coincide, as temporal parts would imply multiple objects existing at the same time.
#### 9. Avoiding the Problem with the Amputation Case
The four-dimensionalist (perdurantist) avoids the problem with the amputation case by accepting that an object can have different temporal parts in different possible worlds. This allows them to avoid committing to any of the unpleasant alternatives (a) – (e) presented in the case and thus sidestep the dilemma.

## Chapter 5 "Personal Identity" from "An Introduction to Metaphysics" by Carroll and Markosian

#### 1. Characterizing the Problem of Personal Identity:
   - **Identity over Time:** Concerned with what it means for an individual to persist through time and change.
   - **The Problem of Time:** Focuses on the relation between personal identity and the passage of time.
   - **The Problem of Unity:** Addresses how various mental and physical states are unified to form a single person.
   - **The Problem of Self-Awareness:** Explores the relationship between self-awareness and personal identity.
   - **The Problem of Change:** Considers how personal identity is affected by changes in psychological or physical characteristics.

#### 2. Approaches to Personal Identity:
   - **Physical Approach:** Defines personal identity in terms of bodily continuity and physical characteristics.
   - **Soulful Approach:** Defines personal identity in terms of the continuity of an immaterial soul or consciousness.
   - **Psychological Approach:** Defines personal identity in terms of psychological continuity, such as memory, consciousness, and personality traits.
   - **Biological Approach:** Defines personal identity in terms of biological continuity, such as genetic makeup and bodily functions.

#### 3. Criticism of Approaches to Personal Identity:
   - Science-fiction examples like transporter cases and brain swapping scenarios serve as useful thought experiments to challenge and explore the implications of different theories of personal identity.
   - While these examples may seem far-fetched, they help illuminate philosophical issues surrounding personal identity and raise important questions about what it means to persist through various changes and transformations.
   - Conclusions drawn from such imaginary cases can shed light on the coherence and plausibility of different theories of personal identity, helping philosophers refine their understanding of the concept.

#### 4. The "No-Criteria" View of Personal Identity:
   - The "no-criteria" view suggests that there are no objective criteria for personal identity; instead, personal identity is a pragmatic or conventional concept.
   - This view challenges the idea that there is a single, determinate answer to questions of personal identity and highlights the fluidity and context-dependence of identity concepts.
   - Regarding moral responsibility, the "no-criteria" view may suggest that notions of personal identity are constructed for practical purposes rather than being grounded in metaphysical reality. This could have implications for how we assign moral responsibility and accountability in cases involving personal identity changes or disruptions.
