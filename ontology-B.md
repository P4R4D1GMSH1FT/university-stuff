## McTaggart's article "The unreality of time"
#### 1. Definitions of A-series and B-series. Which of these concepts refer to permanent distinctions? Which are more fundamental? (p. 458).
- The A-series refers to the temporal ordering of events based on their past, present, and future relations, while the B-series refers to the temporal ordering of events based on their before and after relations. The A-series involves permanent distinctions as it relies on the intrinsic properties of events such as being past, present, or future. It is considered more fundamental as it directly involves the experience of time.
#### 2. What is the relation between time and change? Why is an A series necessary for change? How does McTaggart understand the concept of change (in particular, what is the subject of change in his view)? (pp. 459-460).
- Time and change are intimately connected as change implies the passage of time. An A-series is necessary for change because it provides the framework for events to transition from being future to becoming present and then past. McTaggart views change as a property of events, where the subject of change is the event itself undergoing alteration in its temporal properties.
#### 3. What is the C-series? How does it relate to the A- and B-series? Which series have directions and which don't? Can a non-temporal series have a direction? (pp. 462-463).
- The C-series refers to a series of events ordered solely by their temporal relations without reference to past, present, or future. It relates to the A-series by providing a way to order events without the temporal distinctions inherent in the A-series. The A-series has directions (past, present, future), while the B-series and C-series do not inherently have directions. A non-temporal series cannot have a direction because directionality requires temporal relations.
#### 4. Compare all three series (A, B and C) with respect to their relation to time itself and their fundamentality. (pp. 463-464).
- The A-series is intimately related to the experience of time itself and is considered fundamental as it involves the intrinsic properties of events. The B-series is a more abstract way of ordering events based on their temporal relations without reference to the experience of time. The C-series is even more abstract, ordering events solely by their temporal relations, independent of any temporal distinctions.
#### 5. Two objections to the A theory of time. (pp. 465-466).
- Two objections to the A-theory of time are the problem of temporary intrinsic properties (events changing their temporal relations over time) and the problem of simultaneity (events being both past and present simultaneously).
#### 6. If temporal characteristics of the A-series are relations, what objects do they connect? (pp. 467-468).
- If temporal characteristics of the A-series are relations, they connect events to the temporal framework of past, present, and future.
#### 7. Two variants of McTaggart's argument against the reality of time (identify all its relevant premises). Vicious circularity and infinite regress involved in the A series. (pp. 468-469)
- Two variants of McTaggart's argument against the reality of time involve the notions of either vicious circularity (in defining the A-series) or infinite regress (in trying to ground the reality of the A-series).
#### 8. How does McTaggart define tensed forms of the verb "to be"? Is there any alternative to his definition? (p. 468)
- McTaggart defines tensed forms of the verb "to be" as expressions that involve a temporal relation such as "is past," "is present," or "is future." An alternative definition might involve grounding these forms in tenseless propositions or some other metaphysical framework.
#### 9. The experiential source of the division between the past, present and the future. What is a "specious present"? Is it momentary, or does it have a duration? (pp. 471-472)
- The experiential source of the division between past, present, and future is known as the "specious present," which is the psychological moment wherein one's experience of the present occurs. It is debated whether it is momentary or has a duration, with different interpretations existing.
#### 10. Given McTaggart's argument against the consistency of the A-series, can we still believe that the B and C series exist? (pp. 473-474)
- McTaggart's argument against the consistency of the A-series does not necessarily negate the existence of the B and C-series, as they can still provide alternative ways of ordering events temporally. However, it does challenge the traditional understanding of time as experienced through the A-series.

### Smart
#### 1. Which temporal concepts are anthropocentric and which are not? (p. 94)
- Anthropocentric temporal concepts are those that are centered around human experience and perspective, such as the notions of past, present, and future. Non-anthropocentric concepts are those that are independent of human experience, such as the mathematical framework of spacetime in physics.
#### 2. Are physical objects three-dimensional or four-dimensional? What is Smart's interpretation of change according to the 4D-view? (pp. 94-95)
- According to Smart, physical objects are four-dimensional entities extended across time as well as space. Change, in the 4D-view, is interpreted as different temporal parts of an object existing at different times.
#### 3. The proposed analysis of expressions "past", "present" "future" and tensed verbs. The difference between utterances (tokens) and sentences. Self-referential utterances (token-reflexivity). (p. 95)
- Smart proposes analyzing expressions like "past," "present," and "future" as referring to different temporal parts of spacetime. Utterances (tokens) are specific instances of speech acts, while sentences represent linguistic expressions. Self-referential utterances involve referring to themselves within the context of their own utterance.
#### 4. Try to translate the utterance "This event was future" (or "This event will be past") using Smart's translation scheme. Can it be done?
- 4. Translating the utterance "This event was future" into Smart's translation scheme might involve specifying the temporal part of the event in question that corresponds to what would have been considered future from a certain perspective. However, it might be problematic due to the inherent tenselessness of the 4D-view.
#### 5. Do the words "past" "present" "future" have fixed references? (p. 96)####
- In Smart's view, the words "past," "present," and "future" do not have fixed references; rather, they are relative to different temporal perspectives within the 4D framework.
#### 6. Can events "become" or "come into existence"? Why? (p. 96)
- Smart argues against events "becoming" or "coming into existence" in any substantial sense, as these concepts imply a temporal change that is not compatible with the 4D-view's tenseless ontology.
#### 7. The main argument against the objective flow of time. (p. 97)
- The main argument against the objective flow of time, in Smart's view, might involve pointing out the difficulties in establishing a privileged present moment within the framework of spacetime.
#### 8. An argument from relativity against the existence of an objective "now" (p. 97)
- An argument from relativity against the existence of an objective "now" could involve referencing the relativity of simultaneity, which suggests that the notion of a universal present moment is not compatible with the relativistic understanding of spacetime.
#### 9. Sellars' objection: tenseless verbs are definable in terms of tensed ones. The distinction between tenseless and timeless predicates (pp. 98-99).
- Sellars' objection suggests that tenseless verbs can be defined in terms of tensed ones, thereby undermining the need for tense in our understanding of language. The distinction between tenseless and timeless predicates lies in their temporal reference: tenseless predicates refer to properties that are independent of time, while timeless predicates refer to properties that hold at all times.
### Williams
#### 1. What is the theory of manifold? (p. 457)
- The theory of manifold refers to the mathematical structure representing spacetime, wherein each point corresponds to an event in spacetime.
#### 2. What does it mean "to take time seriously"? (p. 458)
- To "take time seriously" means to acknowledge the reality of time as an integral aspect of our existence and to examine its nature and implications seriously.
#### 3. Two main motives for limiting time (temporal dimension) to the present. (p. 459)
- Two main motives for limiting time to the present might include the desire to simplify our understanding of reality and to avoid metaphysical complexities associated with the passage of time.
#### 4. Two types of metaphors of motion used to describe the passage of time. (pp. 461-462)
- Two types of metaphors of motion used to describe the passage of time might include the river metaphor and the locomotive metaphor, both of which suggest a linear progression from past to future.
#### 5. How do we define motion in the four-dimensional manifold? Can there be any motion that is only in time and not in space? (p. 463)
- Motion in the four-dimensional manifold can be defined as changes in an object's position relative to the spacetime coordinates. There can be motion that is only in time and not in space, such as changes in temporal location without accompanying spatial displacement.
#### 6. The regress argument against the passage of time. (pp. 463-464)
- The regress argument against the passage of time suggests that any attempt to explain the passage of time inevitably leads to an infinite regress of explanations, thereby rendering the notion problematic.
#### 7. Is the passage of time necessary in order to introduce the directionality (arrow) of time? (pp. 464-465)
- Whether the passage of time is necessary for introducing the directionality of time depends on one's philosophical stance. Some argue that time's directionality is inherent in its passage, while others suggest alternative explanations.
#### 8. Is it conceivable to switch the temporal dimension of an object with its spatial dimension? What is a completely isotropic theory of space-time? (pp. 468-469)
- It is conceivable to switch the temporal dimension of an object with its spatial dimension within certain theoretical frameworks, such as theories involving higher-dimensional spacetime. A completely isotropic theory of spacetime would posit that spacetime looks the same in all directions and would lack any inherent directionality.

## Sally Haslanger, "Persistence through time" from The Oxford Handbook of Metaphysics, pp. 315-351. The supporting reading is: M. Loux, "Concrete particulars II. Persistence through time" (without the section "A second argument for perdurantism - change in parts"), pp. 230-247.
#### 1. Two main views on how objects persist: endurantism and perdurantism. The third option: exdurantism (the stage theory) and its analogy with the Lewisian modal theory of counterparts.
- Endurantism posits that objects are wholly present at each moment of their existence, while perdurantism suggests that objects persist through time by having temporal parts. Exdurantism, also known as the stage theory, proposes that objects are not enduring entities but rather sequences of temporal stages. This theory is analogous to David Lewis's modal theory of counterparts, where objects are analyzed in terms of their counterpart relations across possible worlds.
#### 2. A comparison of the available positions on persistence with respect to the following questions:
- **Are ordinary particulars three- or four-dimensional?**
- **How should we interpret statements about diachronic identity (identity across time): as genuine identity statements or something else?
- **Do particulars possess temporal parts in addition to spatial parts?
    Endurantism typically aligns with a three-dimensional view of ordinary particulars, interpreting statements about diachronic identity as genuine identity statements, and denying the existence of temporal parts. Perdurantism, on the other hand, usually adopts a four-dimensional view, interpreting statements about diachronic identity as involving a relation between different temporal parts of an object and affirming the existence of temporal parts.
#### 3. Connections between the problem of persistence and the question of the nature of time.
- The nature of time influences how we conceive of object persistence. The A theory posits a dynamic view of time where past, present, and future are distinct, while the B theory suggests a static view where all times are equally real. Eternalism holds that past, present, and future all exist, while presentism contends that only the present exists. Endurantism can be reconciled with eternalism if it allows for temporal parts, while perdurantism aligns more naturally with eternalism due to its four-dimensional ontology. Similarly, endurantism might be reconciled with presentism if it denies the existence of temporal parts, whereas perdurantism is more compatible with eternalism.
#### 4. The problem of qualitative change and how perdurantism solves it.
- Perdurantism addresses the problem of qualitative change by rejecting the presupposition of the persistence condition, which demands that an object maintains its identity despite changing properties. Perdurantism allows for an object to have different temporal parts with different properties, thereby accommodating qualitative change.
#### 5. Endurantism and the problem of change. Relationism. The problem of intrinsic change and temporary intrinsics.
- Endurantism faces challenges in accounting for intrinsic change, especially when considering temporary intrinsics—properties that an object possesses only temporarily. These temporary intrinsics raise questions about the nature of identity over time and whether temporary intrinsics must be monadic properties.
#### 6. Other solutions of the problem of change for endurantism: temporally qualified instantiations, copula-tensing, adverbialism, and SOF-ism.
- Endurantism offers various solutions to the problem of change, including temporally qualified instantiations, where properties are qualified by time, copula-tensing, which modifies the copula to account for temporal relations, adverbialism, which treats tense as an adverbial modifier, and SOF-ism, which interprets statements about change as statements about different instantiation times.
#### 7. The ontology of perdurantism and the existence of arbitrary compositions of spatiotemporally scattered objects.
- Perdurantism allows for the existence of arbitrary compositions of spatiotemporally scattered objects, raising questions about the ontology of familiar objects versus arbitrary aggregates. The "no change" objection suggests that perdurantism implies a lack of genuine change, as objects are merely collections of temporal parts.

## Peter van Inwagen ("The Doctrine of Arbitrary Undetached Parts")
#### 1. Doctrine of Arbitrary Undetached Parts (DAUP)
The DAUP posits that for any object, there are parts of that object that are arbitrarily chosen and yet are not detached from the object. This means that an object could have parts that are not essential to it and can be arbitrarily added or subtracted without changing the identity of the object. This differs from the claim that there are undetached parts of objects, as the latter suggests that there are parts of objects that are necessarily attached to them and cannot be arbitrarily added or subtracted without altering the identity of the object.
#### 2. Mereological Essentialism (ME) and Mereological Near-Essentialism (MNE)
ME asserts that the parts of an object are essential to its identity, meaning that any change in its parts would result in a change in its identity. MNE weakens this claim by suggesting that while some parts may be essential to an object's identity, others may be near-essential, meaning that they can be changed without altering the object's identity. Van Inwagen finds both ME and MNE unacceptable because they entail that an object has a determinate number of parts, which conflicts with the DAUP.
#### 3. Argument Showing DAUP Entails MNE
Van Inwagen presents an argument to demonstrate that the DAUP entails MNE. This argument relies on identity statements derived from the assumption of DAUP, leading to the conclusion that some parts of objects are near-essential. Heller provides justifications for each identity statement by denying one of the 'unpleasant alternatives' (a) – (e), which are potential objections to the premises of the argument.
4. *Skipped.*
#### 5. Doctrine of Arbitrary Temporal Parts (DATP)
The DATP suggests that for any object extended in time, there are temporal parts of that object that are arbitrarily chosen and yet are not detached from the object. Van Inwagen is skeptical about the existence and intelligibility of temporal parts, as he believes that such parts would violate the principle of arbitrary undetached parts. He does not find any temporal parts that could be seen as non-arbitrary.
6. *For those who participated in the last semester class.*
#### 7. Heller's Explanations of Temporal Parts
Heller provides explanations of temporal parts, suggesting that they are analogous to spatial parts and are necessary for understanding the persistence of material bodies through time. However, it is unlikely that these explanations would change van Inwagen's stance, as he maintains a fundamental skepticism regarding the existence of temporal parts and their coherence. The fundamental difference between van Inwagen and Heller regarding persistence in time of material bodies lies in their respective views on the existence and nature of temporal parts.
#### 8. From the Four-Dimensionalist Point of View
For a four-dimensionalist (perdurantist), an object exists now if it has a temporal part that is present at the current moment. There can be distinct objects that coincide spatiotemporally, as they may have different temporal parts. A three-dimensionalist (endurantist) who wants to accept temporal parts would be committed to distinct objects that coincide, as temporal parts would imply multiple objects existing at the same time.
#### 9. Avoiding the Problem with the Amputation Case
The four-dimensionalist (perdurantist) avoids the problem with the amputation case by accepting that an object can have different temporal parts in different possible worlds. This allows them to avoid committing to any of the unpleasant alternatives (a) – (e) presented in the case and thus sidestep the dilemma.

## Chapter 5 "Personal Identity" from "An Introduction to Metaphysics" by Carroll and Markosian

#### 1. Characterizing the Problem of Personal Identity:
   - **Identity over Time:** Concerned with what it means for an individual to persist through time and change.
   - **The Problem of Time:** Focuses on the relation between personal identity and the passage of time.
   - **The Problem of Unity:** Addresses how various mental and physical states are unified to form a single person.
   - **The Problem of Self-Awareness:** Explores the relationship between self-awareness and personal identity.
   - **The Problem of Change:** Considers how personal identity is affected by changes in psychological or physical characteristics.

#### 2. Approaches to Personal Identity:
   - **Physical Approach:** Defines personal identity in terms of bodily continuity and physical characteristics.
   - **Soulful Approach:** Defines personal identity in terms of the continuity of an immaterial soul or consciousness.
   - **Psychological Approach:** Defines personal identity in terms of psychological continuity, such as memory, consciousness, and personality traits.
   - **Biological Approach:** Defines personal identity in terms of biological continuity, such as genetic makeup and bodily functions.

#### 3. Criticism of Approaches to Personal Identity:
   - Science-fiction examples like transporter cases and brain swapping scenarios serve as useful thought experiments to challenge and explore the implications of different theories of personal identity.
   - While these examples may seem far-fetched, they help illuminate philosophical issues surrounding personal identity and raise important questions about what it means to persist through various changes and transformations.
   - Conclusions drawn from such imaginary cases can shed light on the coherence and plausibility of different theories of personal identity, helping philosophers refine their understanding of the concept.

#### 4. The "No-Criteria" View of Personal Identity:
   - The "no-criteria" view suggests that there are no objective criteria for personal identity; instead, personal identity is a pragmatic or conventional concept.
   - This view challenges the idea that there is a single, determinate answer to questions of personal identity and highlights the fluidity and context-dependence of identity concepts.
   - Regarding moral responsibility, the "no-criteria" view may suggest that notions of personal identity are constructed for practical purposes rather than being grounded in metaphysical reality. This could have implications for how we assign moral responsibility and accountability in cases involving personal identity changes or disruptions.

## midterm exam
#### 1. What are the formal features of the "earlier than" relation between temporal points? Which of these features has to be abandoned in order to allow for the possibility of a branching time?

The formal features of the "earlier than" relation between temporal points typically include:

1. **Asymmetry**: If \(A\) is earlier than \(B\), then \(B\) cannot be earlier than \(A\).
2. **Transitivity**: If \(A\) is earlier than \(B\), and \(B\) is earlier than \(C\), then \(A\) is earlier than \(C\).
3. **Connectedness**: There is a linear, continuous order of temporal points such that any two points are related by the "earlier than" relation.

To allow for the possibility of branching time, the feature of connectedness needs to be abandoned. Branching time implies multiple possible futures stemming from a single present moment, leading to a non-linear or disconnected temporal structure where the "earlier than" relation is not universally transitive or connected.

#### 2. How can we define temporal points (moments) in terms of point-like events? What relation on the set of events do we have to use in such a definition?
Temporal points, or moments, can be defined in terms of point-like events by considering events as momentary occurrences. Each event represents a particular instant in time. 

To define temporal points in terms of events, we typically use a relation called the "precedes" relation. In this relation, one event precedes another if it occurs before it in time. Formally, if \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) are events, \( E_1 \) precedes \( E_2 \) if and only if \( E_1 \) occurs before \( E_2 \). 

This relation establishes the temporal ordering of events, allowing us to identify specific moments in time based on the occurrence of events. Temporal points can then be understood as the instants associated with these point-like events.

#### 3. Describe the concepts of A-series, B-series and C-series and their mutual ontological relations according to McTaggart. What are the main ontological differences between the A-series and the B-series?

McTaggart introduced the concepts of A-series, B-series, and C-series to analyze the structure of time:

1. **A-series**: The A-series describes time in terms of the temporal properties of events, such as pastness, presentness, and futurity. According to the A-series, events are ordered in a dynamic manner, with past events no longer existing, present events currently existing, and future events yet to occur. The A-series captures the subjective experience of time, where events are perceived as changing and moving from future to present to past.

2. **B-series**: The B-series describes time solely in terms of the relations of earlier than and later than. In the B-series, events are ordered statically, without reference to their temporal properties. Each event is simply related to other events as being earlier or later. The B-series represents an objective, unchanging framework for understanding time, where events exist in a fixed temporal order.

3. **C-series**: The C-series represents time as a linear sequence of events ordered by the "earlier than" relation. Unlike the A-series, which focuses on the temporal properties of events, and the B-series, which focuses on their relational order, the C-series treats time as a whole, abstracted from any specific properties or relations of events.

The main ontological difference between the A-series and the B-series lies in their treatment of time's nature:

- The A-series views time as inherently dynamic, with events moving from future to present to past. It emphasizes the passage of time and the reality of temporal becoming.
  
- In contrast, the B-series sees time as static and unchanging. It emphasizes the timeless relations between events and denies the reality of temporal becoming. Time, in the B-series, is more like a spatial dimension, with events laid out in a fixed order.

McTaggart famously argued that both the A-series and the B-series present contradictions, leading him to conclude that time itself is unreal. He believed that the concepts of past, present, and future are inherently contradictory and cannot coherently describe the structure of time.

#### 4. How does McTaggart characterize the notion of change? Compare it with the interpretation of change adopted by the B-theorists of time.

McTaggart characterizes the notion of change in terms of the A-series, which he contrasts with the B-theorists' interpretation:

1. **McTaggart's characterization of change (A-series)**:
   - McTaggart sees change as involving the transition of events from the future, to the present, and then to the past. This progression from futurity to presentness to pastness constitutes the dynamic nature of change.
   - He argues that change involves events acquiring and losing temporal properties such as pastness, presentness, and futurity, which are essential to our subjective experience of time.
   - McTaggart emphasizes the irreducible reality of temporal becoming, where events actively shift from one temporal state to another, leading to the experience of change and the flow of time.

2. **Interpretation of change by B-theorists**:
   - B-theorists reject the notion of temporal becoming and the reality of the A-series properties. Instead, they interpret change as a rearrangement of events within the static temporal order of the B-series.
   - According to B-theorists, events do not genuinely transition from future to present to past; rather, they exist timelessly in their respective positions within the B-series.
   - Change, in the B-theorist's view, is merely a matter of different events being earlier or later than others in the fixed, unchanging temporal order. There is no genuine temporal flow or becoming; events simply occupy different positions in the temporal sequence.

In summary, McTaggart's characterization of change emphasizes the dynamic nature of time, involving the active transition of events through different temporal states. B-theorists, on the other hand, reject temporal becoming and interpret change as a static rearrangement of events within an unchanging temporal order. They view time as a block-like structure where all events exist simultaneously, without any genuine progression or flow.

#### 5. Present the overall structure of McTaggart's argument against the existence of time. Which of its premises are rejected by the A-theorists and B-theorists of time?

McTaggart's argument against the existence of time is famously presented in his paper "The Unreality of Time." The overall structure of his argument can be summarized as follows:

1. **Introduction of the A-series and B-series**: McTaggart introduces the concepts of the A-series (based on temporal properties like past, present, and future) and the B-series (based on the relations of earlier than and later than) as two ways of understanding the temporal structure of reality.

2. **Contradictions in the A-series**: McTaggart argues that the A-series is inherently contradictory. He points out that each event in the A-series must possess the properties of past, present, and future at different times, leading to logical inconsistencies.

3. **Contradictions in the B-series**: McTaggart contends that the B-series also presents contradictions. He argues that the B-series, which lacks the dynamic properties of the A-series, cannot adequately capture the nature of time and change.

4. **Conclusion: Time is Unreal**: McTaggart concludes that both the A-series and the B-series are incapable of providing a coherent account of time. Therefore, he contends that time itself is unreal and that our common-sense perception of temporal passage is illusory.

Now, let's examine which premises of McTaggart's argument are rejected by A-theorists and B-theorists:

- **Premises rejected by A-theorists**:
  - A-theorists reject the conclusion that time is unreal. They argue that while McTaggart's argument may reveal difficulties in conceptualizing time, it doesn't necessarily mean that time itself doesn't exist. A-theorists uphold the reality of temporal becoming and the dynamic nature of time.
  - A-theorists may also challenge McTaggart's characterization of the A-series as inherently contradictory. They argue that our subjective experience of time, including the sense of temporal passage, provides a basis for understanding the reality of the A-series.

- **Premises rejected by B-theorists**:
  - B-theorists reject McTaggart's emphasis on the dynamic nature of time and the reality of temporal becoming. They argue that time is best understood as a static, four-dimensional structure where all events exist simultaneously. Therefore, they reject McTaggart's characterization of the A-series as capturing the true nature of time.
  - B-theorists may also challenge McTaggart's contention that the B-series presents contradictions. They argue that the B-series provides a coherent and objective framework for understanding the temporal order of events, even if it doesn't capture our subjective experience of time.

#### 6. Present the main arguments against the objectivity of the flow of time.

Several arguments challenge the objectivity of the flow of time. Here are some of the main ones:

1. **Time Symmetry in Fundamental Physics**: Many physical theories, such as classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and relativity, are time-symmetric. They treat past and future events equally and do not inherently distinguish between the direction of time. For example, the laws of physics are typically reversible, meaning they apply equally well whether time runs forwards or backwards. This symmetry suggests that the flow of time may be an illusion or a subjective experience rather than an objective feature of reality.

2. **Block Universe View**: According to the block universe view, also known as eternalism, all moments in time exist equally and simultaneously, forming a four-dimensional block of spacetime. In this view, past, present, and future are all equally real and there is no objective passage of time. Rather, our perception of time as flowing or passing is a result of our limited perspective within the block.

3. **Relativity Theory**: Einstein's theory of relativity suggests that time is relative and can vary depending on the observer's motion and gravitational field. This challenges the notion of a universal, objective flow of time. Instead, time is treated as a dimension of spacetime, and different observers may experience time differently.

4. **Temporal Experience**: Our subjective experience of time, including the sensation of temporal flow, is influenced by psychological and neurological factors. For example, our perception of time can be affected by factors such as attention, memory, and emotional state. This subjectivity raises questions about whether the flow of time is an objective feature of reality or merely a product of our cognitive processes.

5. **Entropy and Thermodynamics**: While entropy tends to increase over time according to the second law of thermodynamics, this asymmetry does not necessarily imply a universal flow of time. Some argue that the increase in entropy could simply reflect the directionality of physical processes rather than the passage of time itself.

Overall, these arguments challenge the traditional view of time as a flowing, objective reality and suggest alternative perspectives that emphasize the static, four-dimensional nature of spacetime or the subjective nature of temporal experience.

#### 7. Describe how the B-theorists of time explicate the meaning of tensed verbs and the use of the terms "past", "present" and "future". Use an example to illustrate this interpretation.

B-theorists of time reject the idea of a dynamic, flowing time and instead argue for a static, four-dimensional view of reality where all moments in time exist equally. This perspective raises questions about how to understand the meaning of tensed verbs and the use of terms like "past," "present," and "future" within this framework.

B-theorists typically interpret tensed verbs and temporal terms as referring to different positions within the static temporal order of the B-series. They argue that these terms do not denote real distinctions in the temporal structure of reality but rather serve as linguistic conventions or indexicals that help us organize our experience.

For example, let's consider the sentence: "John will eat dinner tomorrow."

- From a B-theorist perspective, the term "tomorrow" refers to a specific temporal position relative to the speaker's present moment. In the static temporal order of the B-series, "tomorrow" denotes a future event that is located later in the temporal sequence than the speaker's present moment.
- The use of the future tense verb "will eat" indicates that the action of eating dinner occurs at a temporal position beyond the speaker's present moment. This tense is understood in relation to the static temporal order, where the event of eating dinner is positioned later than the speaker's present.

In this interpretation, temporal terms and tensed verbs are understood as indexical expressions that locate events within the fixed temporal framework of the B-series. They do not imply any real passage of time or ontological distinction between past, present, and future but rather serve as convenient ways to communicate about temporal relations within our subjective experience.

#### 8. Characterize the following views regarding the existence of temporal objects: presentism, eternalism, the growing block view, the shrinking block view. What are the presuppositions of these views regarding the objective passage of time?

Let's explore how endurantism, perdurantism, and exdurantism interpret the persistence of objects and analyze the relation of transtemporal identity:

1. **Endurantism**:
   - Endurantism posits that objects persist through time by wholly existing at each moment of time. According to this view, an object is a single, unified entity that persists through time without any temporal parts.
   - Transtemporal identity is analyzed in terms of primitive identity. An object endures through time by maintaining the same identity across different moments, despite undergoing changes in properties or relations. Endurantists typically appeal to primitive identity to explain how an object remains the same entity over time.

2. **Perdurantism**:
   - Perdurantism suggests that objects persist through time by having temporal parts. According to this view, an object extends across time as a four-dimensional entity, with different parts existing at different moments.
   - Transtemporal identity is analyzed in terms of temporal parts. An object's identity is understood as the sum or collection of its temporal parts across different moments. Perdurantists argue that an object can change and evolve over time while still maintaining its identity as the same entity, albeit with different temporal parts at different moments.

3. **Exdurantism**:
   - Exdurantism proposes that objects persist through time by being "stretched" across time without enduring through it. According to this view, an object is not a single entity that persists through time but rather a series of momentary stages or "temporal slices."
   - Transtemporal identity is analyzed in terms of temporal stages. An object's identity is understood as the collection of its temporal stages across different moments. Exdurantists argue that an object's identity is determined by the pattern or arrangement of its temporal stages over time, rather than by any enduring entity persisting through time.

In summary, endurantism, perdurantism, and exdurantism offer different perspectives on how objects persist through time and how their identities are maintained across different moments. Endurantism emphasizes the enduring nature of objects as single entities, perdurantism focuses on objects having temporal parts, and exdurantism views objects as collections of momentary stages. Each view provides a distinct account of transtemporal identity based on its understanding of persistence through time.
Sure, let's characterize each of these views regarding the existence of temporal objects and their presuppositions regarding the objective passage of time:

1. **Presentism**:
   - Presentism holds that only present objects and events exist. Past and future objects and events are considered to be nonexistent. 
   - Presupposition: Presentism presupposes an objective passage of time, where the present moment continuously moves forward, and only the present is real. Past moments are seen as having ceased to exist, and future moments are yet to come into existence.

2. **Eternalism**:
   - Eternalism, also known as the "block universe" view, posits that all moments in time, past, present, and future, exist equally and are ontologically on par with one another.
   - Presupposition: Eternalism does not presuppose an objective passage of time. Instead, it views time as a static, four-dimensional block where all moments coexist. Past, present, and future are all equally real, and there is no privileged present moment.

3. **Growing Block View**:
   - The Growing Block View maintains that past and present objects and events exist, but future ones do not. It combines elements of presentism and eternalism by acknowledging the reality of past and present while denying the existence of the future.
   - Presupposition: The Growing Block View presupposes an objective passage of time, where new moments continuously come into existence, adding to the growing block of reality. Past moments are fixed and existing, while future moments do not yet exist but will become part of the block as time progresses.

4. **Shrinking Block View**:
   - The Shrinking Block View posits that only present and future objects and events exist, while past ones do not. This view is the inverse of the Growing Block View.
   - Presupposition: The Shrinking Block View also presupposes an objective passage of time, but in this case, the block of reality is continuously shrinking as moments move from the future to the present and then cease to exist as past moments. This view sees the future as open and yet to be determined, with only the present being fixed and real.

Each of these views offers a different perspective on the nature of time and the existence of temporal objects, with corresponding presuppositions about the nature of objective temporal passage.

#### 9. How do the positions of endurantism, perdurantism and exdurantism interpret persistence of objects? How do they analyze the relation of transtemporal identity?

#### 10. What is the problem of change with respect to properties? How can the endurantist solve this problem?

The problem of change with respect to properties arises from the observation that objects undergo changes in their properties over time. This raises questions about how objects can maintain their identity despite undergoing such changes. Specifically, the problem can be framed as follows:

1. **Problem**: If an object undergoes a change in one or more of its properties, how can it remain the same object over time? For example, if a rose changes color from red to pink, how can it still be considered the same rose?

2. **Challenge for Identity**: The problem challenges the notion of identity over time. It questions how an object can persist through change while maintaining its identity as the same entity.

Endurantists propose a solution to this problem by appealing to the notion of temporal parts and primitive identity. Here's how they address the problem:

1. **Temporal Parts**: Endurantists argue that an object exists wholly at each moment of time. Therefore, an object's properties at any given moment are properties of the whole object at that moment.

2. **Primitive Identity**: Endurantists posit that an object's identity is grounded in primitive identity, which is a fundamental and unanalyzable relation. According to this view, an object is identical to itself at each moment of its existence.

3. **Persistence Conditions**: Endurantists propose that an object persists through time by satisfying certain persistence conditions, which specify that the object remains the same object as long as it has the same primitive identity at each moment.

4. **Preservation of Identity**: When an object undergoes a change in its properties, endurantists argue that it remains the same object because it maintains the same primitive identity throughout the change. Despite the changes in properties, the object's identity is preserved because it is identical to itself at each moment.

In summary, endurantists address the problem of change with respect to properties by appealing to the notion of primitive identity and arguing that objects maintain their identity over time by having the same identity at each moment of their existence, even as they undergo changes in their properties.
