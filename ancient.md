## Socrates (The Apology)

###### 1. The beginnings of Socrates’ philosophical activity (the oracle). The nature of Socrates’ mission. Questions about Socrates’ religiousness (his attitude towards gods/god).

- The delphi oracle supposed he is the wisest man, however Socrates denies that. He starts to raise the questions, as he ought to find someone wiser than himself. After meeting people who thought they were wise and deciding that no one of them possess wisdom, yet he thought he is the better man, because he was aware that he is not wise. He did not believe in god/gods, and that was one of the accusations in the trial.

###### 2. What kind of values Socrates claims are the most important ones in human life? The problem of virtue and the need of pursuing the excellence of the soul.

- virtue (arete) = knowledge (of the good) = happiness
    
- arete - virtue, excellence, goodness = knowledge of good and bad, those are values that make the soul of a man more excellent, this is the most important thing in life
    
- It is teachable, yet it is difficult to be a successful virtue teacher.
    
###### 3. The problem of knowledge and ignorance. Skepticism. Religious aspects.

- Socrates opened the dialogue with the thought that philosophy starts with ignorance. He also claims that people who fear death are ignorant, as it may not be evil, but good. Socrates is not aware of being knowledgeable, saying he knows that he knows nothing. That doubt of him can be seen as skeptical. 
    

###### 4. Three typical elements of Socrates’ philosophical activity:

- Socrates’ ethical claim: no one does evil knowingly.

	- It is linked to the equation of arete = happiness = knowledge, because then knowledge would be crossed out of the equation. A good man cannot be harmed by an evil one.

- Socrates’ confession of ignorance

	- He starts his defense with a confession of ignorance, also saying that philosophy starts with ignorance. The famous quote of him says that he knows that he knows nothing.

- Socrates’ divinity (the daimonion)

	- The daimonion (divinity) is a force which stops from behaving unethically, it contacts him to tell him that death is not an evil, can be good.
    
### Plato’s Phaedo

###### 1. Why is the philosopher ready to die? What is the „exercise in dying” he practices during his life? How can he prepare for a good death?

- Death is the ideal home for soul, yet man should not commit suicide. Philosophers should love wisdom and the eternal, not the passions and appetites of the body, like pleasure, wealth, fame, and he will be the closest to wisdom in death, as body and senses no longer distract him. He should not see death as a bad thing, as it is the purification from the body.

###### 2. The practical nature of philosophy in the Phaedo (philosophy as a way of life).

- Philosophy is a way of life as it can make your death good, thinking you can achieve full wisdom after that. Philosophers also thrive for arete, the moral values, which bring happiness.

###### 3. Proofs of immortality of the soul in the Phaedo (you need to be able to present two):

- the proof from contraries (from generation and corruption)

	- Proof of contraries, also known as the Cyclical argument - Forms are eternal and unchanging. Soul always brings life and must not die. Only the body dies, the soul is indestructible. Plato also suggests an analogy of fire and cold - cold is imperishable and fire is within close proximity, would withdraw as the soul after the death of the physical body.

- the proof from the fact of anamnesis (recollection)

	- The proof of recollection says that we possess some non-empirical knowledge at birth, so the soul had to exist before the physical body, as it had to carry that knowledge.
    
- the proof from the similarity of the soul to the ideas

	- The final argument says that the Forms are the cause of all things in the world and all things participate in Forms. Then the soul participates in the Form of Life, meaning that soul cannot die.
    
- the proof from the notion of soul as a principle of life

	- The affinity argument says that incorporeal, invisible, immortal things are different from corporeal, visible and mortal things. Soul is the former and will continue to live, while the body is the latter and will die and decay.
    

###### 4. In what way Plato describes the soul in the Phaedo?

(similar to the ideas, the principle of life, opposed to the body)

- Plato explains that soul is similar to ideas in the sense that everything is created out of Forms, so is soul. The soul would be then created by the Form of Life, meaning that it will continue to live after death of the physical body. The principle of life is to raise the excellence of the soul by knowledge and virtues.
###### 5. Theory of Ideas in the Phaedo (features of ideas, examples of ideas, theory of ideas as a hypothesis, what are the reasons for introducing ideas?)

- Theory of Ideas is also known as Theory of Forms. There are Forms like Forms of Numbers (mathematics), Forms of Life, Forms of Justice and Forms of Beauty. It is said that the real, sensible world is not as real or true as those eternal, unchangeable ideas. Plato introduced them as a way to understand the reality, because the forms are the cause of existence of all the things in the world as well as sole objects of knowledge. He brought up the argument from science, movement change, cause, relativity, but also Anaxagoras’ idea about the mind being the cause of all things.
###### 7. Socrates’ philosophical evolution depicted in the Phaedo.

- He spends his last days of his life evaluating the nature of the soul, he is not in sadness because of having to drink a poison, he rather thinks about the position he is in, losing the physical body and making the soul have no further limits. He becomes detached from the needs
    
### The Phaedrus

###### 1. Structure of the human soul (the tripartite division: rational part, spirited part, appetitive part); functions and features of each of the parts.

1. rational part - reason, truth, goodness
2. spirited part - higher emotions, glory
3. appetitive part - desires, pleasure

###### 2. The proof of soul’s immortality in the Phaedrus.

- In Phaedrus, the soul is said to transmigrate, also known as metempsychosis, which allows the soul to reenter the cycle after death of the body. He also speaks up about the essence of immortality and its self-movement, the “arche”, uncreated and indestructible origin which provides all movement.
###### 3. The world of Forms – their epistemological and ontological description. Pay attention to the expressions “place beyond the heavens” and “true being” (ousia ontōs ousa).

- Plato is convinced that the world we live in is not reality, but a collection of phenomena linked to Forms. Plato’s ontology is concerned with what is real and his epistemology with what is theory of knowledge. Place beyond heavens is a place where all ideas of real things are collected together, while the winged charioteer, like the gods, should aim to ascend to the highest sphere, beyond the heavens, where it will behold Ousia Ontôs Ousa, "with which true knowledge is concerned; the colorless, formless, intangible essence, visible only to mind"
### The Republic, Book VI

###### 1. The metaphor of the state as a ship. What kind of thinking about politics is present in the metaphor?

- Owner of the ship - the strongest, not very bright    
- Sailors - steer the ship, follow their desires
- The captain - true captain, true steerman, techne
- The politicians are seen as sailors, who instead of being true leaders and doing good for their state, follow their own desires for their own pleasure.
###### 2. The metaphor of the beast trainer. Who are Plato’s adversaries in the metaphor? What kind of thinking about ethical values is involved in Plato’s perspective? What kind of philosophical questions lie behind this metaphor?

- Socrates presents the just and unjust man by creating a vision of every human having three animals inside him, multi-headed beast, lion and human. When the man is behaving unjustly, then it is said that he feeds the beast and lion inside him, making them stronger, and starving the human, which makes him weaker. In the just man the human has the most control, domesticating the beast and making the lion his ally. He is questioning the importance of rational part and divine reason, implying that we should be ruled by the latter.
###### 3. The Idea of the Good.

- Good is seen as the virtues, the moral values which are beneficial, while the highest good is seen both as pleasure and knowledge.
###### 4. The division of the line:
- the distinction between visible and invisible world
- ontology and epistemology
- hierarchy of types of cognition and hierarchy of types of being
- the structure of the world of Forms
- how, from a methodological point of view, is the theory of Forms presented in this passage?

- Socrates asks to take a line, divide it into two unequal parts and then divide the two in the same proportion. The first two parts are said to represent the visible world and the other two the intelligible world. The hierarchy goes from the lowest - AB, low - BC, high - CD to the highest - DE. AB is about the likeness of guesses of things perceived by the senses. BC is about the actual objects and probable predictions/beliefs. CD is about assuming the hypotheses while making use of likeness about the ideas, knowledge but not only the intelligible. DE is fully intelligible, making no use of likeness, the ideas it concerns are given by the Good. In the epistemological meaning, he does not accept direct perception and true belief as knowledge, because it is not sufficient for a philosopher to understand Forms, he needs to understand the relation between given levels.
### The Republic, Book VII
###### 1. The allegory of the Cave:
- explanation of the elements: prisoners and shadows, moving objects, the fire, the world outside the cave
- cave - material/sensible world
- fire - sun
- shadows - material objects, perception
- statues - copies of real objects, general concepts made up by the society
###### 2. The route up and down the cave. What is the spiritual and philosophical meaning of this route? The pedagogical mission of the philosopher (psychagogia). The notion of the turning of the soul. Practical nature of philosophy.

- While down the case, prisoners are chained to the wall behind them. Behind the wall there is fire and people walking around with puppets, which cast a shadow prisoners can see. The shadows are reality for them.
    
- When the prisoners are released, they would see fire and the light would blind him. They would not believe that the reality is what they see now, not the shadows they have seen before. Slowly his eyes adjust to the light, making him see reflections of the people and things. Only when he can look at the sun, he is able to reason about it.
    
- The ex-prisoner would think that the world outside the cave is superior and he would want to share it with other prisoners. He would go blind once again when entering the cave and other prisoners would infer that the journey out of the cave was what harmed him. Socrates concludes that the prisoners, if they were able, would reach and kill anyone who would try to drag them out of the cave.
### Timaeus
###### 1. The origin of the visible universe. The principles involved in the process of its generation:
- the demiurge (the craftsman, the Father)
- the eternal paradigm (model)
- the lesser gods
- origins of the notion of matter (the receptacle, „the mother”)

- The world was created because of the goodness of the Demiurge, so the Form of the Good is the source of being, then by organizing the disordered matter it had been before the creation of the world became the visible world, as it was formless because of lack of essence. The cosmos became beautified, organized unity. He put the intelligence in the soul and the soul in the body, as the world is a living creature. The lesser gods were creating the man. It is said that children are born not by the single parent, but by the mother and father. The mother was the space, while the father was the forms. Mother is in which the created thing (world) comes to be. 
###### 2. Important notions used to describe the nature and generation of the universe (explain each of them):

- the world-soul (the structure of the world soul)
	- The world soul is created by the Same (intelligible reality), Different (sensible reality) and Being (intermediate element). Demiurge then divided it by mathematical proportions, forming an ‘X’ shape and connecting it by the ends, making two crossing circles. The outer one was the Same, turning horizontally to the right, and the inner one was the Different, turning diagonally to the left. He left the outer  undivided, but divided the inner one into six parts, to have seven unequal circles, making orbits of heavenly bodies. Then he connected the body and soul.
    
- teleological explanations („for the sake of”)
	- Teleological explanations tells about some gods supposed to be stars or planets, as well as having orbits of the soul and trying to get them in order in the process of growing up and becoming more rational.
    

- distinction between divine cause and necessity

- the four elements
	- There are four elements: fire, air, water and earth.
	- geometrical account of the four elements
	- fire - tetrahedron
	- air - octahedron
	- water - icosahedron
	- earth - cube
###### 3. The generation and structure of the human soul. The generation of the human body.

- tripartite division of the human soul

- immortality of the soul

- reincarnation

- moral law

- The human soul is made out of the same mixture as the world soul and the soul of gods. He implemented the affections: pleasure, pains, boldness and fears, anger and expectation as well as sense perception and desire. The immortal soul of the gods is mixed here with a destructible body. The divine part of the soul (intellect) is placed in the head, the mortal part in the thorax, the desire part in the region of the liver. While reincarnation, the soul passes to a body with moral value of previous existence, the quality of exercising the reason.
###### 4. Relation between the demiurge and his creations (lesser gods, the universe, human souls). Question of freedom.

- Lesser gods - here to create a man
    
- The universe - creates unchanging and eternal model
    
- Human souls - worse than world soul
###### 5. Ethical aspects in the Timaeus:

- the relation between human body and soul (the ideal of harmony between body and soul)

- the parallels between the human body and soul and the body and soul of the universe (microcosm-macrocosm, the need for exercise of the body, the need for motions in the soul similar to the revolutions of the soul of the universe)

- There is a need to exercise the body, laws of nature and not following desires (liver area), bones and flesh consist of four elements and excess or defect of those causes the bodily and psychic diseases.
## Aristotle

### Nicomachean Ethics

###### 1. The many types of goods (good is the end toward which an action is directed); distinction between goods that are means to other ends and goods that are ends in themselves. Which science is most suitable to study the highest good according to Aristotle? Special methodological status of ethics. (I.1-3)

- There are (a) external goods e.g. wealth, honor, (b) goods of the body e.g. health, strength and goods of the soul e.g. virtue, knowledge, (1) certain goods e.g. life and health, (2) others e.g. wealth, friends, fame, honor, (3) possession and exercise of virtue. Goods which are the end in itself need to be self-sufficient (fulfill a desire for a good life) and bring happiness. 
###### 2. Happiness as the highest good. What kind of arguments Aristotle gives for this position? (I.4-7)

- Aristotle claims that happiness is the highest good even in the moments of pain, by finding the golden mean and making your soul more excellent by virtues, you can feel a bit of happiness. It is also at the bottom of every pursuit we engage in.
###### 3. Different elements which constitute happiness according to Aristotle. Aristotle’s definition of happiness – defined as activity in accordance with the best kind of virtue. Relations between happiness, activity and virtue (areté). (I.7-12)

- Happiness is not a state, but an activity that lasts lifelong, virtue equals reason and the function of a man is to be rational, and activity in accordance to that means the activity of the soul, what brings the highest good.
###### 4. Theory of virtue:

- types of virtue: intellectual and moral virtue. Their subdivisions. The relation between types of virtue and division of soul (I.13). Book 2

- different ways of acquiring virtue (activity, habit, education). (II.1-4)

- different features of moral virtue. Relations with pleasure. Final definition of moral virtue as the state (hexis, habitual disposition) disposing the owner to have the right type of pleasure and pain or the state disposing to the right kind of action. (II.5-6)

- intellectual virtues - through teaching; participating the rational part

- moral virtues - by forming a habit of exercise/activity, they affect the character of a man, hexis - state (stable); participating the rational part and emotions (pathe), pleasure
###### 5. The notion of the “golden mean” and its role in defining excellence (virtue). (II.5-9)

- Golden mean is a point in between excess (on one end) and deficiency (on the other end). Finding the balance point is in fact acting morally. He takes an example of courage, where the excess point is recklessness and in deficiency cowardice. The balance point is virtue.
### Metaphysics
###### 1. First philosophy – the science that investigates being as being (being qua being) in IV.1-2. Comparison with the notion of first philosophy in Book VI.1.

- First philosophy - metaphysics
###### 2. Topics treated by first philosophy (IV.1-2):

- notion of “being as being” (being qua being); many senses of being (being is said in many ways); introduction of the notion of substance; the primacy of substance;

- essential attributes of being (that which belong to being in virtue of its own nature)

- first logical principles (principle of non-contradiction; principle of the excluded middle)

- Being qua being is studied by episteme. Yet, Aristotle does not think that there is a genus of being. Being qua being does not study only one type of being (ousia, substance) but all kinds.
###### 3. The division of sciences according to Aristotle in VI.1. Three theoretical sciences. First philosophy as theology. Comparison with the conception from IV.1.

- 1. natural objects - physics, natural philosophy (exist in movement, studied with movement and matter)
    
2. mathematical objects (exist in movement, studied without movement or matter)

3. immovable objects - theology

###### 5. The primacy of substance – as a category of being. How is it justified? The question “What is substance?” is equivalent to the perennial question of philosophy: “What is being?”. (VII.1)

- Substance is a form, matter, compound, non predicated, not common, zeta he considers four candidates for substance (1) the essence of a thing (2) the universal (3) the genus (4) the material substrate

The essence of a thing is about “what it is to be a thing” so “What is substance?” equals “What is being?”
###### 6. The study of substance (VII.2-4):

- what types of substances exist? (the so-called “population question”); in particular: are there only sensible substances, or also suprasensible (non-sensible)?

- what is substance? (the so-called “definitional question”) what is to be a substance? three candidates for substance: form, matter and the composite of the two

- bodies (including plants, animals, heavenly bodies), things more basic than bodies (surfaces, lines, points), imperceptible things (Platonic Forms, mathematical objects), he leaves open question whether there are non-sensible substances, but the clearest examples are perceptible ones
    
- substance is something that has a form, matter and compound, in zeta he considers four candidates for substance (1) the essence of a thing (2) the universal (3) the genus (4) the material substrate
###### 7. Universal entities rejected as candidates for substance (VII.13); main argument: if universals are substances each substance will consist of many substances (e.g. a particular human of animal, rational, human, body etc.); if universals are substances many particulars will be one because they will have one substance.

- !!!
###### 8. Form as primary substance (VII.17). What are the arguments?

- Substance has to be both separable and individual, so is the form.
###### 9. The distinction between potentiality and actuality. Different types of potentiality (book IX)

- potentiality - something is possible to happen; there is WEAK and STRONG sense of potentiality; WEAK - “might choose to happen or not to happen”; STRONG - how something could be done well 
    
- actuality - anything that is currently happening; ENERGEIA - examples as pleasure (energeia of human body) and happiness (energeia of human being as human); ENTELECHEIA - doing complete work, way of being in motion
###### 10. Different examples and different types of relations between actuality and potentiality. The primacy of actuality over potentiality.

- ^ Potentiality can come to exist actually.
###### 12. The proof for the existence of the Prime Mover (his existence is necessary if motion is eternal). (Book XII, 6-8)

- Prime mover is the primary cause of all the motion in the universe; immortal unchanging being responsible for all wholeness and orderliness of the sensible world.
###### 13. The nature of the Prime Mover (pure act, the most perfect entity, unmoved is the first cause of movement, pure thought itself). How does the Prime Mover move other beings? (as the object of desire)

- Prime Mover number, number of separate movements - the number of celestial spheres i.e. 47 or 55.
### On the Soul (De Anima)
###### 1. The soul is defined by means of Aristotle’s main metaphysical notions: actuality, potency, form, matter. (II.1) The notion of life (II.2). Soul as the first actuality of the natural body endowed with organs.

- Soul is the first actuality/form of a natural body endowed with organs, having life potentiality.
###### 2. Three types of soul (vegetative, sensitive, rational). Five powers of the soul (nutritive, sensitive, appetitive, moving, rational). (II.1-4)

- plants: nutritive, animals: nutritive, sensitive, appetitive, moving, human being: nutritive, sensitive, appetitive, moving, rational
###### 3. Nature of the sensitive power. (II.2-4, 12; esp. II.12 where the metaphysical definition of sense is to be found)

 1. special sensible objects (colors, sounds, smells)
 2. common sensible objects
 3. accidental sensible objects
 4. The nature and functions of the common sense (book II.6 and III.1-2).

- objects of perception which cannot be perceived by another sense (more like what/where), common sense does not require a sense organ like other senses,
###### 5. Distinctions between: sense perception, imagination, thinking (III.3).

- Sense perception - using sense organs, passive
- Imagination - sensible, sensitive; not thinking - belief, rational only; not perception - not passive; not opinion - belief, rational only
- thinking - using reason, intellect, not any organ
###### 6. The nature of the thinking power (the intellect, the intellective power). The nature of the intellect – a different kind of soul. (III.4)

- intellect = grasp -> reason -> thinking, receptive (intelligible forms: grasps essence)
    intellect is a different kind of soul
###### 7. Two modes of the intellect: active and passive. (III.4-5) Division into three intellects: one similar to matter, one similar to act and light; one “passive” and perishable.

- active 1. like matter 2. like light is IMMORTAL, passive is affected
###### 8. The problem of the immortality of the rational soul in Aristotle (III.5) (famous problem in all subsequent debates on Aristotle’s anthropology, discussed vehemently till the end of Renaissance). The question: are there two or three intellects in Aristotle?

- three: like matter - material potential intellect, like light - active or productive intellect, passive/effective - affected intellect
    
## Stoicism

Cleanthes’ Hymn to Zeus + texts in Kenny:

###### 1. The Stoic notion of deity (logos, pneuma, corporeal, immanent).

- Logos is the universal reason, principle of world/nature/cosmos, its order is governed by that.
    
- Pneuma is the “breath of life”, mixture of air and fire organizing both the individual and the cosmos, in the highest form constitutes the human soul (fragment of Zeus’ soul), for Stoics, everything consists of matter and pneuma
    
- Corporealism is tied to Stoics’ idea that only bodies are, or have being
    
- Immanence is one of central Stoics’ physical theory, that is how they view God - immersed into nature
###### 2. The Stoic division of things into good, bad and indifferent.

- Good and Bad things affect HAPPINESS; indifferent neither help nor harm

## Epictetus, Handbook (Encheiridion)

###### 2. Human freedom according to Epictetus. The distinction between things belonging to us and not belonging to us; the distinction between things good, bad and having no value. (central element of Stoic ethics - cf. also the two passages from Diogenes Laertius quoted by A. Kenny)

- We, human beings have things which are up to us e.g. opinions, impulses, desires, aversions and on the other hand, things that are not up to us e.g. bodies, possessions, reputations, public offices. Epictetus talks about the volitional states as fear, hope, desire, which eventually up to us will make us happy/unhappy. You can be well if you follow the virtue.
###### 3. How Epictetus conceives the religious piety and the reverence towards gods (cf. The Handbook, paragraph 31)?

- It is an important virtue in Greece, Stoics say that what we think about gods (belief) is more important than what we do.
###### 4. Social dimension of Epictetus’ ethics (the importance of the place one has in the structure of society).

- Women are called ladies when they are fourteen, they are honored by appearing modest, and self-respecting
    
- Someone talking bad about you is in the belief that he acts appropriately
    
- If your brother has acted unjustly, hold the handle of the other side so it could be carried.
###### 5. The relation between ethics and other branches of philosophy. Divisions of philosophy according to the Stoics and the mutual relations between particular branches. (ethics, physics, logic) - cf. The Handbook, especially paragraphs 49 and 52).

- The goal of philosophy is to learn about nature and follow it.
    
1. Dealing with philosophical propositions as “not to hold to falsehood”
2. demonstrations “must one not hold to falsehood?”
3. confirmation and articulation of these "Why is this a demonstration? What is demonstration? What is entailment? What is conflict? What is truth? What is falsity?"

- Third comes from second and second from first.
### Epicurus (Letter to Menoikeus and Principal Doctrines):

###### 1. Epicurean view of reality and the gods: only bodies exist; atoms and vacuum; lack of determinism (parenclusis of atoms); Gods as eternal and happy creatures – lack of interest in humans, lack of providence.

- God is an indestructible and blessed animal, they exist as we have knowledge of them.
###### 2. What is the goal of philosophy according to Epicurus? What is happiness and how can we achieve it?

- Philosophy brings good things we can owe gratitude to, both in young and old, and practicing it exercises the soul and health of the soul equals happiness.
###### 2. Epicurean theory of pleasure: what is good and evil according to Epicurus? definition of pleasure (lack of pain); different types of pleasures and different types of needs (natural, unnecessary and harmful; corporeal and spiritual). The role of moderation in ethics.

- Good is pleasure (lack of pain in the body and lack of discomfort in the soul), Evil is pain. Desires can be natural or groundless (empty), and natural can be necessary and unnecessary.
###### 3. Tetrapharmakon (the Fourfold Medicine): Epicurean answer to fear of death, fear of Gods, the fear of evil and the fear of not being able to achieve what is good.

- Fourfold Medicine: 
	1. Do not fear God

	2. Do not worry about death

	3. What is good is easy to get

	4. What is terrible is easy to endure

###### 1. Epicurean theory of justice, society and morality.

- Neither harm no one nor be harmed

- There is no justice or injustice when there is inability

- Justice is not a thing on its own

- Injustice is not a bad thing on its own

## The Skeptics (Sextus Empiricus, Pyrrhonian outlines):

###### 1. What is the nature and the goal of skepticism? The notions of lack of anxiety and of suspension of judgement. Different ways to achieve the suspension of judgement (so called canons).

- Skeptics continue to search for the truth when Dogmatists believe they have already discovered it. Their goal is freedom from disturbance. Someone who thinks that something is honorable or bad by nature will be disturbed. Freedom from disturbance follows from suspension of judgement. It can be achieved by opposing appearances to appearances, opposing ideas to appearances, opposing things according to different conceptions.
## Philo of Alexandria (On the world's creation)

###### 1. Philo’s account of the creation of the world (God, ideas in god’s mind; two phases of creation – the intelligible and the sensible world; the logos).

- God has powers as Maker and Father. He creates the world in six days (perfect number) and assigns some of the parts of creation to each of them. In the first day he created the intelligible world, ensuring that corporeal objects correspond to incorporeal ideas. The light and darkness became the first ideas in the cosmos. The sensible creation consisted of earth and human being. Logos (of God) was a divine power which gave the ideas ordered disposition.

###### 2. Do we find in Philo the notion of creation out of nothing? In what sense? What different senses of the expression can you distinguish?

- Philo thinks that nothing can be created out of nothing, as well as something that exists cannot become non-existent.

###### 3. The fall of man: the biblical story and two interpretations by Philo – the two trees (of life and of knowledge of good and evil) and the relation between fear of god and piety on the one hand and the rational prudence on the other; the story of Man, Woman and the Serpent. Explain the elements of these images according to Philo and show how they are different and what different traditions they represent.

- All the plants possess soul and reason, bearing the fruit in the form of virtues by which what is good and what is evil is recognized.
    
- The serpent is the pleasure humans cannot reject. It is said that man is the intellect and woman the sense-perception. Pleasure encounters the senses first, that is why the woman was first to encounter the serpent and then share it with the man.
## Plotinus, topics

Obligatory reading: Ennead V.1, chs. 1-9; Ennead V.2 (entire text)

Additional: Ennead I.6, chs. 1-2, 5-6, 7-9;

###### 1. Plotinus’ metaphysics: three hypostases (One, Intellect, Soul); the distinction between the intelligible world and the sensible world; Plotinus'; doctrine of “emanation” (flowing out). (Ennead V.2 (complete), Ennead V.1, 4-8). Notion of hypostasis.

- One - supreme, transcendent, is the all things and not the single one of them
- Intellect - activity, life that it sends out creates another reality
- Soul - breathes life into things, honorable and divine
- Intelligible world - Sensible world - beautiful, animals, plants, some gods
- Emanation - the One emanates existents, even if he has no need of acting in a creative capacity
###### 2. The specific Plotinian idea of the origin of reality: the One and the Intellect do not create but rather generate or give birth; subsequent levels of reality flow out (emanate) out of their principles. How is Soul’s creating different? Two phases of generation: Procession and reversion.

- Soul continues to create matter, then reverts to ascend.
###### 3. The fall of the soul (oblivion about its own nature), Ennead V.1, chs. 1-4.

- When the descent of a soul is complete and reorientation to the One commences, matter keeps the soul contained.
###### 4. The nature of the Soul (movement, change, time, two-fold movement – up and down, creates like an artist). How does Plotinus describe the dignity of the soul and its superiority to the body? What kind of level or parts can we distinguish within the hypostasis of the Soul?

- Higher - unchangeable, divine
    
- Lower - seat of the personality, passions, vice
    
- led him to neglect an ethics of the individual human being in favor of a mystical or soteric doctrine of the soul’s ascent to union with its higher part
