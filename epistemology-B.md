### Philosophy of mind

##### 1. What is dualism? 
- Dualism is an approach to the philosophy of mind problem, in which it is believed that mind and body, as well as mental phenomena and physical phenomena are separated from each other. The physical being is material and the mental one is immaterial.
##### 2. What was the role of the pineal gland for Descartes? How did Descartes justify the special role of the pineal gland? 
- In Descartes’ thought the pineal gland is an organ in the centre of the brain. It is said that the pineal gland is the place of soul and thought-forming. It was involved in sensation, imagination, memory and the causation of bodily movements as well, playing a big role in his concept of a hypothetical man resembling a machine. The pineal gland description featured a notion of presence of animal spirits inside the pineal gland and a pattern in which the animal spirits flow from the pineal gland.

##### 3. Explain the mind-body problem as clearly as possible.
- When the physical being is material and mental one is immaterial, then the material, spatial being cannot be causally related to the immaterial and aspatial one. The two major perspectives on that problem are dualism and materialism.

##### 4. What are the traditional solutions to the mind-body problem? 
- dualism – interactionism (Descartes)
- dualism – parallelism (Leibniz)
- dualism – occasionalism (Malebranche)
	- (dualism – epiphenomenalism)
- materialism (Hobbes, La Mettrie, d'Holbach)
- idealism (Berkeley)
- neutral monism (Spinoza, Hegel, Russell)

##### 5. What is the difference between methodological and philosophical behaviorism?
- Methodological behaviourism claims that psychology as a science must not use concepts that are not intersubjectively verifiable and that psychology is a science of behaviour, which is intersubjectively verifiable. However, philosophical behaviourism, also called logical or analytical behaviourism, claims that folk psychology concepts are intersubjective.

##### 6. Explain the behaviorist view of mental concepts. 
- Behaviourists believe that there is an intrinsic relation between mind and behaviour. It does not claim that Folk Psychology pickout entities i.e. beliefs and desires are not entities. Philosophical behaviourism, also called logical or analytical behaviourism, claims that every mental sentence can be paraphrased in terms of purely behavioural sentence.

##### 7. Explain one argument against the behaviorist view. 
- One of the arguments against behaviourist view is concering the danger of circularity. 

For example “Julia likes the colour pink”, if Julia is asked whether she likes the colour pink, she will answer positively, given that she understands what it means. She understands what it means. So, if Julia is asked “do you like the colour pink?”, she will answer positively if she likes the colour pink and negatively if she does not. 

The claim “Julia likes the colour pink” and the fact that she will answer positively to the question concerning whether she likes the colour pink if she likes the colour pink makes that view circular.

##### 8. What is the identity theory? 
- The identity theory can be explained by “mind = brain”. In Cartesian myth, that theory can be characterized by the positive attitude towards the reducibility of Folk Psychology + to neurosciences. It puts the mind and the brain together, also reducing the mental states to neural states.

##### 9. Explain why the identity theory is committed to reductionism. 
- Identity theory is committed to reductionism by claiming that mind = brain i.e. the mental concepts are reduced to neuroscientific concepts. Reduction means that the mental phenomena can be fully explained by the physical phenomena.    

##### 10. Explain the objection to the identity theory that artificial intelligence is impossible. 
- Identity theory makes artificial intelligence impossible by positing that mental states are identical to physical states and that the mental states are reducible to the processes in the brain. AI cannot experience genuine consciousness. 

##### 11. What is the thesis of multiple realizability of mental states? 
- Thesis of multiple realizability of mental states claims that the mental states can be realized by different physical systems. Focusing on the mental state of pain, human realize it by the neural activity of the brain accurate to its species. However, pain can be realized also by the other organisms, meaning that its is realized by more than one physical system.

##### 12. How would a functionalist characterize a mental state (such as pain)? 
- By a functionalist, a mental state such as pain would be characterized by the input of an event causing the mental state, output of an event that is caused by this type cause and the internal role of connection between the mental state of that type and other mental types. So, the pain could be characterized by the input: typically external damage to the tissues of an organism, output: typically withdraw from the source of damage and internal role: causing other mental states to help an organism avoid pain.

##### 13. “Functionalism is a synthesis of dualism, behaviorism and identity theory”. Explain. 
- 1. Dualism proposes that the mind and body are distinct, characterizing the mind as immaterial and aspatial, as well as the body as material and spatial. 2. Behaviourism focuses on observable behaviour, claiming that it is the only one intersubjectively verifiable. 3. Identity theory proposes that mind = brain; human mental states are brain states. However, functionalism 1. proposes that there is no non-physical mind, yet pays attention to the relation between the mental states and the environment, 2. recognizes both observable and mental states, proposing that the latter can also be inferred from the first one (even though they cannot be observed), 3. proposes that mind/brain = software/hardware, taking into account the virtue of causal/functional role played.

##### 14. Explain Searle’s Chinese room argument. Why does it challenge functionalism?
- Searle’s Chinese room argument focuses on the usage of the machine by giving it the input in English for receiving the output in Chinese. The argument makes distinctions between Strong AI and Weak AI, where the first AI would actually understand Chinese and the second one simply simulates understanding Chinese, but does not really understand it. The machine uses the program to convert the input script into the output characters. Functionalism claims that the mind is the functional organization of the given object e.g. human mind is the functional organization of the brain and computer mind is the functional organization of the computer.

### Perception
##### 1. Explain the difference between direct and indirect realism. 
- Direct realism claims that we perceive external objects themselves and directly. Indirect realism claims that we perceive external objects indirectly, as we only directly perceive intermediaries; sense-data, which are not only the mental objects.

##### 2. Explain the difference between naïve and representational versions of indirect realism.
- Naive indirect realism proposes that the intermediaries; sense-data we perceive have the same properties as external objects. However, the representational indirect realism claims that the primary qualities of the object are shared by object and sense-data, when the secondary qualities are the properties of sense-data only, depending on the interaction of primary qualities and the perceptual apparatus.

##### 3. Explain the argument from illusion (be sure to explain both parts of the  argument).
- Argument of illusion supports indirect realism, it contains part I: case of illusion and part II: veridical case. It begins with the observation that we sometimes fall prey to illusions (e.g. straight stick looks bent in water), which concludes that we directly perceive the mental objects rather than physical ones.

Part I: case of illusion - In case of illusion, A is aware of something being F, when the real object is not F (e.g. aware of the stick being bent when it is not bent). If A is aware of something being F, then there is something of which A is aware that is F. Since in the case of illusion the real object is not F, A is not aware of the real object but of the intermediary object (sense-datum) which is F.

Part II: veridical case - A is aware of something being F and the real object is F as well (e.g A is aware of the stick being straight when it is straight). The appearances of object form a continuum: varying the perspective, A will be aware of various bent sense-data, until A becomes (smoothly) aware of a straight object and then again about various bent sense-data. From A’s point of view there is no distinction between veridical and non-veridical experiences. It would be absurd to think that in the veridical case A perceives the object directly, while A perceives the sense-datum in other cases. In the veridical case, A perceives a sense-datum, which is F (just like the real object).

##### 4. What is the phenomenal principle? What role does it play in the argument from illusion?
- Phenomenal principle means that if A is aware of something being F then there is something of which A is aware, that is F. ==If a is aware that $x Fx then $x (Fx & a is aware that Fx==. Austin & Ayer debate concerning argument from illusion and phenomenal principle featured Austin claiming that the phenomenal principle relies on an unwarranted distinction between veridical and illusory experiences.

##### 5. What objections have been leveled against the phenomenal principle?
- The principle does not hold for other intentional attitudes e.g. beliefs. E.g someone believes in ghosts. If A believes that there are ghosts, then there is something that is a ghost and A believes that it is a ghost.

##### 6. What is the sense-datum theory of perception?
- Sense-datum theory of perception focuses on the thesis that we are actually directly aware of sense-data. We have direct perceptual knowledge about sense-data (incorrigible) and indirect perceptual knowledge about external objects (corrigible).

##### 7. Explain one objection to the sense-datum theory.

- Postulation of suspect (private, mental) entities (challengers of dualism, Wittgenstein’s private language argument)
- Postulation of sense-data introduces a “veil of perception”, leaving us no cognitive access to the world, but only to these mental intermediaries
- No explanatory value

- In order to account for a perception relation, it posits a new “direct perception” relation
- It makes the task of investigating a nature of the new relation even more intractable since it obtains in a private realm
- It poses a task of investigating the relation between mental sense-data and physical objects which in view of existence of the mind-body problem looks problematic

##### 8. What is the adverbial theory of perception?
- Adverbial theory of perception rejects the phenomenal principle (I seem to see a bent stick, but there is nothing that is bent (in the world or in the mind) and claims that we can perceive an object (e.g. straight stick) in a different manners (bently or straightly). It avoids ontological commitments e.g. Julia has hiccups by using ‘Julia hiccups’ rather than ‘Ex (Hiccups(x) &  Possesses(Jack, x))’    

##### 9. Explain Jackson’s argument against the adverbial theory.
- Suppose that John experiences brown square and green triangle simultaneously and Ann experiences green square and brown triangle simultaneously. John’s experience would be rendered as: John experiences brownly and squarely and greenly and triangularly. Ann’s experience would be rendered as: Ann experiences greenly and squarely and brownly and triangularly. The commutativity and associativity of conjunction make their experience the same, even if it is not.

##### 10. What is the intentionalist theory of perception?
- Perceptual experience is a form of intentionality or mental representation
- Perception is a form of belief
- Perceiving is acquiring perceptual beliefs
- Common element (in the illusory and veridical cases)
- Not perceptual object
- But intentional content
- How the world is represented as a being
- How the stick is bent
- How there is a dagger in front of me
- Intentional content exhausts phenomenal content

##### 11. Explain one objection to the theory.

- Intentionalist theory of perception does not does not adequately distinguish perception from other forms of intentionality. It does not take into account the phenomenological, qualitative character of the experience, as well as the representation can occur without the raw feels.

##### 12. Explain the disjunctivist theory of perception.
- Disjunctivist theory of perception rejects the assumption that there is something in common between veridical and non-veridical experiences. It considers hallucination as different kind of state altogether. Sometimes the veridical and non-veridical experiences can be subjectively indistinguishable. Austin thinks there is no reason to think that they are of the same kind e.g. two different kinds of tea can be indistinguishable for many of us.

##### 13. Compare and contrast the sense-datum, the intentionalist and the disjunctivist theory of perception. 
- The sense-datum, the intentionalist and the disjunctivist theory of perception differ in their explanation about the relation of our perception and external world. Sense-datum theory claims that we do not perceive an actual object, but mental entities called sense-data. Our perception of the external world is said to be mediated by these intermediate mental entities. The intentionalist theory propose that perception involves a representation of the objects in the external world. Our perceptual experiences have intentional properties that refer to these external objects. The disjunctivism theory focus on a difference between veridical and non-veridical perceptions. Veridical perceptions directly acquaint us with the external world and non-veridical ones are distinct.

##### 14. What is the distinction between a priori and a posteriori knowledge?
- A priori knowledge and a posteriori knowledge are a distinction appearing in the epistemological aspect of knowledge. A priori knowledge can be known independently of any experience and could be arrived at just by the usage of reason. A posteriori knowledge is an empirical type of knowledge, knowledge is based on the experience or observation.

##### 15. Explain the analytic-synthetic distinction.
- Analytic-synthetic knowledge is linked to epistemological aspect of knowledge. The proposition is considered analytic knowledge when the predicate is contained in the subject e.g. all bachelors are unmarried (subject -> bachelor: unmarried men; predicate -> unmarried). On the other hand, synthetic knowledge is characterized by predicate not being contained in the subject e.g. all bachelors are handsome (subject -> bachelor: unmarried men; predicate -> handsome).

##### 16. Explain the distinction between necessary and contingent propositions.

- **Necessary propositions:**
	- Necessarily true:
		- 2+2=4
	    - All bachelors are unmarried.
    
	- Necessarily false:
		- a≠a
		- There is a bachelor who is unmarried.
    
**p is necessary iff it has the same truth-value in all possible worlds**

**- Contingent propositions:**
	- Contingently true:
		- The maple is on the right.
		- The dinosaurs became extinct approximately 66 million years ago.
	- Contingently false:
		- The maple is on the left.
		- The dinosaurs became extinct in the Middle Ages.

**p is contingent iff there are possible worlds, in which p is true, and there are possible worlds in which p is false**

### Truth & Realism
##### 1. Explain the terms: ‘truth-bearer’, ‘truth-maker’. Illustrate them with a chosen theory of truth.
- Truth-bearer is any belief, sentence, proposition, utterance, while truth-makers are facts, coherence relations etc. According to the correspondence theory of truth, which states that truth is a relationship between proposition and the corresponding facts or states of affairs in the world, the truth-bearer is the proposition and the truth-maker is the corresponding fact that the proposition represents e.g. the proposition “It is raining” (truth-bearer) corresponds to the actual fact of rain falling outside (truth-maker).
##### 2. What is the correspondence theory of truth? 
- Correspondence theory of truth focuses on the relationship between a given proposition and the actual state of affairs in the world i.e. in the early version (A1) x is true iff x corresponds to some fact (A2) x is false iff x does not correspond to any fact. Later it addressed the some state of affairs that obstains.

##### 3. What is the principle of bivalence? 
- Principle of bivalence is connected to the correspondence theory of truth. It says that every proposition is either true or false, but is different from the law of excluded middle i.e. either p or not p.

##### 4. What is the principle of transcendence? 
- Principle of transcendence is connected to the correspondence theory of truth. It says that a proposition could be true even if nobody is or could be in a position to know about it.

##### 5. Explain the problem of obscurity and the problem of peculiar facts. How did B. Russell answer these problems?
- Problem of obscurity, also the problem of agreement, addressed the problem of similarity i.e. the sentences and facts are not really similar and that sentence has a propositional structure which reality does not have. Russell answered to the problem of peculiar facts by the Logical atomism i.e. only the elementary facts exist, which correspond to atomic sentences - it cancelled the need to posit the peculiar facts. His base clause for atomic sentences was (C1) x is true iff there is a corresponding fact (C2) x is not true iff there is no corresponding fact. Recurrent clause for non-atomic sentences was presented as “not p” is true iff p is not true, “p or q” is true if either p is true or q is true.

##### 6. What is the problem of epistemic access to truth?
- Problem of epistemic access to truth corresponds to the lack of clearness about how anyone could ever be in a position to know that a certain sentence etc. is true. The early version of it is presented as (B1) x is true iff x corresponds to some state of affairs that obtains (B2) x is false iff x corresponds to some state of affairs that does not obtain. 

##### 7. What are truth-value gaps? Why do they constitute a problem for the correspondence theory of truth?
- Truth-value gaps correspond to the paradoxical statements, vague statements and statements about non-existent objects and manners - sentences which are neither true nor false. They constitute a problem for the correspondence theory of truth because the principle of bivalence ought to be rejected.

##### 8. What is the coherence theory of truth? What role does the idea of the specified set play in the theory?
- Coherence theory of truth’s basic proposition is that p is true iff the set S U {p} is coherent (S – specified set). The logical consistency is necessary but not sufficient for the coherence as it could be too weak. E.g. proposition p is logically consistent with proposition q. However, proposition p is also logically consistent with proposition ~q (they can both be true together). It means that coherence based only on logical consistency would make p coherent both with q and ~q. Logical entailment would work better to capture the intuition of relatedness between propositions on the above argument. Coherence of set arguments is greater because of the greater number of logically consistent beliefs within the set, greater number of probabilistic consistent beliefs within the set, the greater number and strength of inferential connection between beliefs within the set, smaller number of divisions and anomalies.

##### 9. Is the principle of bivalence accepted by the coherence theory of truth?
- Principle of bivalence is only accepted by the idealistic coherence theory with a set of beliefs from omniscient being. Putnam’s and Peirce’s coherence theory with a set of propositions arriven at in the limit does not accept the bivalence. 

##### 10. What is the principles of weak (strong) transcendence? Is it accepted by the coherence theory of truth?
- Principle of weak transcendence says that a proposition can be true even if nobody knows it. Principle of strong transcendence says that a proposition can be true even if nobody is in the position to know about it. Principle of weak transcendence is accepted both by idealistic coherence theory and Peirce’s and Putnam’s coherence theory, when the principle of strong transcendence is accepted only by the idealistic coherence theory.

##### 11. What is the transcendence problem? Why does the coherence theory of truth lead to relativism? Do these objections equally affect all versions of the coherence theory of truth?
- Transcendence problem is that some propositions can be true or false even if they do not stand in coherence relations e.g. “Kochanowski wrote exactly two words 2 days after his daughter’s death.”, “Shakespeare sneezed twice, 2 minutes before midnight on Christmas in 1600.”. It is not a problem in the idealistic version of coherence theory. However, in the Peirce’s and Putnam’s view these propositions are neither true nor false and it is considered as truth-value gaps.

##### 12. What is the pragmatist theory of truth?
- Pragmatist theory of truth defines truth in terms of practical consequences, focusing on the usefulness and effectiveness of given statements. It emphasizes the truth viewed as a process, rather than a fixed state.

##### 13. Explain two objections to the pragmatist theory of truth.
- 1. Pragmatist theory of truth ignores the correspondence to objective reality. Rather than involving an alignment between statements and the way the world is, pragmatist theory of truth focuses solely on practical consequences.
- 2. It does not take into account the coherence of statements, making the truth-value gaps possible.

##### 14. Explain the liar paradox. 
- Liar paradox occurs when the (1) This sentence is false (2) (S) sentence (S) is false. It means that if (S) is true then what it says is the case, but what (S) says is that (S) is false. However, if (S) is false then what it says is not the case, what (S) says is that (S) is false. That case can be seen e.g. in logical puzzle Knights and Knaves.

##### 15. What is a Tarski biconditional? What role do such biconditionals play in Tarski’s theory of truth.
- Tarski claimed that for every sentence s of language L definition of truth must imply T-sentences - Tarski’s biconditionals.

	(T) ‘s’ is true iff s

	‘Snow is white’ is true iff snow is white

	‘Śnieg jest biały’ is true iff snow is white

Biconditionals play role in Tarski’s recursive theory of truth. Truth is reduced to the reference e.g. ‘snow’ refers to snow, ‘grass’ refers to grass and to the satisfaction e.g. for every x, x satisfies “is white” iff x is white. Tarski’s biconditional is featured both in the reference and satisfaction of truth.

##### 16. “Tarski offers a reductive theory of truth.” Explain. (Note: You do not need to recite Tarski’s definition of truth, but you should be able to explain the form that the definition takes.)
- Tarski offers a reductive theory of truth by introducing base clauses, truth-functional clauses and universal clauses. The base clause is satisfied when sentence ‘a is P’ is true iff the referent of ‘a’ satisfies ‘P’. The truth-functional clauses are satisfied when any sentence of the form ‘not p’ is true iff p is not true and ‘either p or q’ is true iff either p is true or q is true. The universal clauses are satisfied when any sentence of a form ‘Everything is P’ is true iff all referents satisfy ‘is P’.

##### 17. What is Tarski’s meta-language hierarchy?
- Tarski’s meta-language hierarchy consists of Object Language (L0) and Meta-languages (L1, L2, L3, …, Ln). The object language L0 is the language used to talk about the world (not about any language), meta-language L1 is used to talk about the object language (and also possibly about the world - Tarski’s conditionals are formed in the meta-language L1 but talk about the world and object language L0), meta-language L2 is used to talk about meta-language L1 (and also possibly about the world and object language L0), meta-language L3 is used to talk about meta-language L2 (and also possibly about the world, object language L0 and meta-language L1), etc.

##### 18. How does Tarski’s theory solve the liar paradoxes?
- Tarski’s theory solves the liar paradoxes by accepting that no well formed sentence can be formulated in its own meta-language. Yet, liar paradoxes are formulated in their own meta-language. It is not formulated in object language L0 because it does not talk about the world, rather about a language; sentence. The sentence S is supposed to belong in the L1, so the paradox would be formulated in the L2. Then, sentence S is supposed to belong in the L2, which makes the paradox belong in the L3 and so on… Liar paradoxes are not formulated within any closed language in the hierarchy of languages.

##### 19. What is the problem of the Big Fact?
- Problem of the Big Fact features the advantage of semantic theories of truth relying on extensional relations (e.g. Biconditionals in T-sentences). However, it cost that the biconditionals are equally true as the biconditionals are filled in with conjunction of what is the case (e.g. ‘snow is white’ is true iff snow is white and yellow is a color).

##### 20. How can one respond to the problem of epistemic access to truth on behalf of Tarski?
- The problem of epistemic access to truth on behalf of Tarski is less sharp because of the reduction of truth to the reference and the satisfaction. As long as we are competent language users, there is no special problem of epistemic access to the truth. At any rate the problem reduces the problem of epistemic access to truth to reference and satisfaction (can we know that our words mean what they do?)

##### 21. Explain the claims of the deflationist theories of truth. 
- Deflationism theories of truth negate the metaphysical theory of truth - when correspondence/coherence/pragmatic theory is based on the metaphysical assumption that there is substantive nature of truth, deflationism denies it. Deflationists also do not see the truth as a real predicate - example of a real property: being a material object e.g. falling pen, the Earth orbiting the Sun (the bodies are subject to the law of gravity). Contrast it with the truth property: London is the capital of the UK, the Earth orbits the Sun. Both are true, they seem to have nothing in common (except for being true), no regularities are being associated with it. If you fix the world with all physical (mental, linguaistic, social) properties, you have fixed everything. ADDING THE TRUTH PROPERTY WILL MAKE NO DIFFERENCE TO THE WORLD.  

##### 22. What kinds of deflationist theories are there? Explain their basic claims.
###### Precursors
- The performative theory of truth (Strawson) - Strawson’s performative theory of truth had the problem with classical theories of truth considering the assumption that sentences such as “it is true that p” state facts, e.g. “close the door” does not state any fact.
- The prosentential theory of truth - “That is true” as a prosentence, not a sentence, it has anaphoric function: connects up with a sentence that precedes it. “That is false” is a prosentence of the negation of a preceding sentence.

###### Deflationism proper
- Redundancy theory (Ramsey, Prior) - in the Redundancy theory the truth predicate is redundant (superfluous) treating Tarski biconditionals as recipes for eliminating truth predicate from the discourse, e.g. “Snow is white” is true iff snow is white.
- Disquotationalism (Quine, Field) - Truth is disquotation (getting rid of quotation marks) i.e. whenever we encounter a sentence in quotation marks ‘p’ to which the truth predicate applies, we are allowed to disquote the sentence - write: p. It is licenced by Tarski biconditionals (T) ‘p’ is true iff p; ‘雪の様に白い ’ is true iff 雪の様に白い .
- Minimalism (Horwich) - propositions (not sentences) are truth-bearers, there is no problem with applying to sentences one does not understand. Unlike Tarski, Horwich sees no need to provide a general definition of truth. In minimalism a person grasps the concept of truth iff they are capable of accepting an infinite numbers of truth axioms of the form: (E) The proposition that p is true if p

##### 23. Explain two objections to deflationism.
- 1. Problem of falsehood - the theory of falsehood does not follow from the theory of truth. On some theories (e.g. disquotationalism) falsehood may be ought to be a hybrid device for a disquotation and negation at the same time.
2. Problems in expressing the correspondence intuition. (*) Sentence ‘Snow is white’ is true because the snow is white - when we deflate the first term of the biconditional we receive - (*) Snow is white because snow is white WHICH IS FALSE

##### 24. What is the principle of bivalence? Give one example each of (a) a theory of truth that accepts the principle and (b) a theory of truth that rejects the principle.
- Principle of bivalence is a logical principle stating that the proposition must be either true or false. 
1.  Tarski’s recursive theory of truth
2.  Peirce’s and Putnam’s coherence theory

##### 25. What is the principle of strong transcendence? Give one example each of (a) a theory of truth that accepts the principle and (b) a theory of truth that rejects the principle.
- Strong transcendence says that a proposition can be true even if nobody is in the position to know about it.
	1.  Idealistic coherence theory    
	2.  Peirce’s and Putnam’s coherence theory

##### 26. Explain two versions of anti-realist claims.
- **More moderate anti-realism:**
		Xs exist (existence claim)
		Xs are NOT independent of us (independence claim)

- **More radical anti-realism:**
		Xs do NOT exist (existence claim)

##### 27. What is scientific realism?
- Scientific realism claims that the world is the way that it is depicted by true scientific theories - if a true scientific theory involves claims about electrons, quarks, etc. then they exist.

##### 28. What is the verificationist theory of meaning? 
- The verificationist theory of meaning claims that the meaning of a statement is determined by its method of verification or confirmation. The statement can be meaningful only if it has empirical consequences i.e. this theory rejects metaphysics.

##### 29. How has the verificationist theory of meaning led to scientific anti-realism?
- Scientific anti-realism proposes two types of statements: observational statements - unquestioned and theoretical statements - according to verificationism, the meaning of a theoretical statement S is exhausted by the totality of its observational consequences Obs(S). That means verificationist theory of meaning led to scientific anti-realism by the possibility of replacing S with Obs(S) e.g. replacing S - theoretical statement about DNA with Obs(S) - set of all empirical consequences of S makes us have no reason to believe that DNA exist.

##### 30. How have scientific realists responded?
- Scientific realists responded by undermining verificationism as the status of the verifiability principle is itself problematic, Quine attacked with the two dogmas of empiricism, extending the empirical -if the use of eyeglasses is not allowed, then what is empirical will be related to the observer’s eyesight, etc., and the convergence argument - claim: A (hitherto unknown) planet exists
	Supported by converging evidence from many directions

##### 31. What is Putnam’s internal realism?
- Putnam’s internal realism is a realism limited to certain framework, e.g. “What exists?” can only be answered in a certain framework. The answer to the question “How many objects are in this room?” depends on the meaning of ‘object’ - commonsense meaning, carpenter meaning, physics meaning, etc.

##### 32. How does Dummett propose to resolve the realism-antirealism debate?
- Dummett proposes to resolve the realism-antirealism debate by analyzing our language by the theory of meaning - verificationist is rejected, truth-conditional Dummett rejects, justificationist is put forward. Justificationist theory of meaning relies on giving the meaning of a sentence is to state the conditions under which the sentence is warrantedly assertible. Dummett concluded it is possible that we are realists relative to some areas (e.g. about the past) but anti-realists relative to other areas (e.g. about the mind)

### Skepticism
##### 1. What is the difference between academic and Pyrrhonic skepticism?
- Academic skepticism took a form of “I do not know that ___”, when Pyrrhonic skepticism took a form of “I withhold judgement as to whether I know that ___”

##### 2. Explain the error argument for skepticism. (Dancy, ch. 1, §1.2)
- We have made genuine mistakes in the past, we did not know that they were mistakes then. Otherwise, they would not be genuine mistakes and there is no way to tell whether you are about to make genuine mistake. So, there is no way to tell whether you are not making a mistake now (in believing that ___).

##### 3. Explain the argument from experience. (Dancy, ch. 1, §1.2)
- Argument from experience says that we do not possess knowledge about the unobserved. This causes a problem for induction, as we cannot assume things we have not yet observed e.g. whether black swans exist. 

##### 4. What is the closure principle? (Dancy, ch. 1, §1.2)
- Closure principle addresses the relationship between reasons and actions. [Kap & (Kap -> Kar)] -> Kar - logically valid, instance of modus ponens; [Kap & Ka(p -> r)] -> Kar - closure principle, intuitive but not evident, its truth is contested by some; [Kap & (p -> r)] -> Kar - false, as a might not see the connection.
##### 5. What are the closure principle arguments for skepticism? (Dancy, ch. 1, §1.2) How can such arguments be challenged? (Dancy, ch. 3, §3.3)
- Closure principle arguments for skepticism is that you cannot know the statement of common knowledge, e.g. let ‘s’ stand for a skeptical hypothesis (I am a Brain in a Vat) and ‘p’ for the common knowledge statement (I have two hands). 

	~Ka~s   I do not know that I am not a BiV
	Ka(p ® ~s)  I know that if I have two hands then I am not a BiV
	[Kap & Ka(p ® ~s)] ® Ka~s  (closure principle)
---
	~Kap  I do not know that I have two hands

##### 6. How do the epistemological externalists challenge skepticism?
- Epistemological externalists challenge skepticism by claiming that we only have knowledge, not meta-knowledge. Reliable belief-forming process is necessary for knowledge, not that we be justified in believing that they are reliable.

	If the skeptical hypothesis is true, then we do not have knowledge.
	
	If the skeptical hypothesis is false, then (it is positive that) we have knowledge (if our beliefs are reliable, truth-tracking)

##### 7. How does Moore prove that the external world exists? How does he challenge skepticism? (Is this a successful challenge?)
- Moore proves that the external world exist by a simple proof:
	I have two hands
	If I have two hands then the external world exists
	So, the external world exists

In his proof he accepts the closure principle (he uses it in ‘So, the external world exists’).  Moore claims that we have better reasons to understand our commonsense beliefs than any philosophical thesis. However, when applied e.g. to the court example where all evidence shows that X murdered Y, the defence could argue that:
	The judge (S) does not know that S is not a BiV.
	S knows that if X murdered Y then S is not a BiV
	(By closure) the judge (S) does not know that X murdered Y

Finding such a defence of X would be ridiculous. It shows something important about the skeptical doubts and the attitude to them.

##### 8. What is the central claim of contextualism? How do contextualists respond to skepticism?
- Central claim of contextualism is that the standards which beliefs must satisfy in order to count as knowledge depend on the context. The context could be a philosophical discussion, where the skeptical hypotheses  are considered; medium in the context of a courtroom; they are low in the context of everyday interactions (“do you know what time it is”. Contextualists respond to skepticism by claiming that we are equivocating on ‘know’ when thinking that there is a contradiction in the problem of BiV:

	¨The problem is that we seem to want to accept all three of the following propositions, which seem jointly inconsistent (if closure principle is true):

	I know that I have two hands
	I know that if I have two hands then I’m not a BiV
	I don’t know that I’m not a BiV

We need to realize that, in some cases, we are using ‘know’ presupposing a low-standard contexts, in other a high standard context:
	I know(low)   that I have two hands
	I know(low/high)   that if I have two hands then I’m not a BiV
	I don’t know(high) that I’m not a BiV
In other words, the skeptical argument relies on contextual equivocation.

##### 9. What is the idealist/phenomenalist response to skepticism?
- Idealist/phenomenalist response to skepticism is based on the definition of the material objects. For idealists, material objects are perceptions. For phenomenalists, material objects are the permanent possibilities of perception. Idealist/phenomenalist response by claiming that we are able to have knowledge about them.

##### 10. What is the verificationist response to skepticism?
- Verificationist response to skepticism features the claim that skeptical and non-skeptical hypotheses alike are non verifiable; meaningless and nonsensical.

##### 11. Wittgenstein says: “If you are not certain of any fact, you cannot be certain of the meaning of your words either” (On Certainty, 114). Explain Wittgenstein’s challenge to the skeptic.
- Wittgenstein’s challenge to the skeptic relies on self-refuting Cartesian doubt and its methodological doubt, doubting everything that can be doubted. Wittgenstein comes up with the Hyperbolic doubt - connection between a word and its meaning is said to be contingent, which can be doubted according to Descartes. However, if the connection between the words and meaning could be doubted, then skeptics would not be able to form their arguments.
