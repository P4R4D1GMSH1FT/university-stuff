##### 1. Astronomical data available to the ancient observers.
1. The diurnal motion of the celestial sphere (including the Sun, the Moon and the stars) from east to west. The sphere rotates around a fixed point (the North Star, Polaris). The elevation of the North Star depends on the latitude (distance from the Equator).    
2. The annual motion of the Sun in the easterly direction in relation to the fixed stars. 
3. The Sun follows the ecliptic (a great circle on the celestial sphere).
4. Due to the annual motion of the Sun the highest point on its daily journey varies with seasons. Summer and winter solstice and equinoxes. 
5. A special type of stars: planets (“wanderers”). They generally move with respect to the fixed stars in the easterly direction with various speeds.
6. Planets remain close to the ecliptic (the path of the Sun) within the Zodiac strip.
7. There are five planets known to the ancients: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. Mercury and Venus always stay close to each other (and to the Sun), while the remaining planets wander freely around the Zodiac.
8. The planets’ forward motion is interspersed with periods of “backward motion” (retrograde motion). These periods occur only once a year for Mars, Jupiter and Saturn (so-called outer planets), but more than once for Mercury and Venus (inner planets).
9. The forward motion of the planets is not uniform (their speeds vary throughout the year). The planets’ brightness varies too (in contrast with the fixed stars).
##### 2. The main elements of the Ptolemaic model of the universe (deferents, epicycles, equants, eccentrics) and their role in explaining the data.
1. Circular motions of the celestial bodies (argument from perfection).
2. The Earth in the center of the universe (geocentrism).
3. The motions of the planets are superpositions of two circular motions: on the deferent (a big circle with the Earth at its center) and on the epicycle (a small circle with its center on the deferent). This accounts for the retrograde motion.
4. The Earth has to be put off-center the deferent (in the eccentric) to explain the variations in brightness.
5. Introduction of the equant (explaining the variations of a planet’s speed).
6. Assumption that the Sun-Earth radius is always parallel to the radius of the epicycle for outer planets. This explains why these planets have only one instance of retrograde motion in a year.
7. Assumption that the center of the epicycle for inner planets remains on the Earth-Sun line (explains why these planets stay close to the Sun).
##### 3. Ad hoc assumptions used by Ptolemy.
- Many elements of the Ptolemeic model have an ad hoc character: the model does not unify the observable phenomena, as well as the theory contains a number of independent assumptions that do not have a deeper explanation.
##### 4. The Copernican model and its explanation of the observable astronomical phenomena (in particular the retrograde motion of the planets).
1. The Sun in the center of the universe.
2. Planets (including the Earth) orbit the Sun in perfect circles (the only exception: the Moon).
3. Some epicycles were necessary to account for variations in the observable motions of the planets (later abandoned when elliptical orbits were introduced). Eccentrics were used too.
4. Retrograde motion: a result of the combination of the Earth’s motion and the motion of the planet (when the Earth “overtakes” the planet, it seems to move backward).
5. Outer planets: the Earth overtakes them exactly once a year.
6. Inner planets: their orbits are within the Earth’s orbit, so they always seem to be close to the Sun.*
7. The variations of the brightness and velocity of the planets: explained by the variation of the distance from the Earth to the planet.
##### 5. The notion of an experimentum crucis. Different predictions made by the heliocentric and geocentric systems.
1. Two theories T1 and T2 make different (contradictory) predictions (T1predicts p, and T2 predicts not-p). We can empirically verify whether p or not-p, and therefore choose between T1 and T2.
##### 6. The basic assumptions of the Aristotelian mechanics (Aristotle's law of free fall and his principle of dynamics). Arguments against the existence of vacuum.
	1. Two types of motion: natural and forced.
	2. Two types of matter: celestial and terrestial.
	3. For celestial objects their natural motion was circular.
	4. For terrestial objects natural motions were in straight vertical lines (upwards or downwards). 
	5. All other motions require external causes.
1. The (unnatural) motion of a body has to be constantly sustained by the action of force (cause). Without a force the body will slow down and come to rest. The velocity of an object is proportional to the impressed force and inversely proportional to the resistance of a medium.
2. The time of fall is proportional to the weight.
##### 7. Galileo's a priori argument against Aristotle's law of free fall. Galileo's law of free fall.
1. There is no significant difference in falling times for objects with different weights. What matters is not the weight but the air resistance (related to the shape and density of a falling object).
2. All objects fall at the same rate regardless of their weight.
##### 8. Galileo's principle of inertia and his supporting argument using inclines.
1. If we push an object downhill, its speed increases
2. If we push an object uphill, its speed decreases.
3. So if we push an object on a level plain it should neither accelerate, nor decelerate.
##### 9. Galileo's analysis of uniformly accelerated motions.
1. All objects participating in the Earth’s motion carry this motion even when separated from it (an example with a ship and a cannon ball dropped from its mast).
##### 10. Galileo's relativity principle and inertial motions.
1. Example: projectile motion. A cannonball shot parallel to the Earth surface participates in two motions: a horizontal uniform motion and a vertical, accelerated motion. They combine to create a parabolic trajectory.
2. Experiment with two balls: one shot, the other dropped. They reach the surface at the same time.
##### 11. Galileo’s principle of relativity: all mechanical phenomena follow the same laws in all inertial frames of reference.
1. An inertial frame of reference: a frame of reference that does not accelerate. No ‘fictitious forces’ (such as the centrifugal force).
##### 12. Newton's laws of dynamics and their methodological status (are they empirical or a priori?). Possible definitions of forces, inertial masses and equal temporal intervals.
1. The principle of inertia: without an impressed force an object moves uniformly in a straight line (F=0v=const.)
2. F=ma, where a is acceleration (the rate of change of velocity)
3. The action-reaction principle: two isolated objects act upon each other with the same force in opposite directions (m1a1=-m2a2)
##### 13. Newton's derivation of the universal law of gravity. The role of Kepler's laws of planetary motion.
1. The goal: to find a mathematical form of a force that could keep planets on their orbits as described by Kepler’s laws of planetary motion.
2. Newton’s reasoning showing that the force has to be central and inversely proportional to the squared distance between a planet and the Sun.
3. Step 1. Geometric argument showing that Kepler’s second law can be true only when the force is directed centrally towards the Sun.
4. Step 2. Calculating the formula for the centripetal acceleration of an object in circular motion.
5. Step 3. Calculating the central force necessary to keep a planet on its orbit (using the third Kepler’s law). 
##### 14. The successes of Newton's theory of gravity (explanation of tides).
1. Understanding the Periodic Nature of Tides: Newton's theory of gravity explained the periodic rise and fall of the tides observed in oceans and other bodies of water. He proposed that the gravitational attraction between the Earth and the Moon, along with the gravitational interaction between the Earth and the Sun, played a significant role in generating tidal forces.
2. Lunar and Solar Influence: Newton's theory helped to understand the dual nature of tides, which are influenced by both the Moon and the Sun. The gravitational force exerted by the Moon is stronger due to its closer proximity to Earth, resulting in the dominant effect on tides. However, the gravitational force of the Sun also contributes to the overall tidal pattern, causing variations in the tide heights.
3. Spring and Neap Tides: Newton's theory explained the occurrence of spring and neap tides, which are variations in the height of tides throughout the lunar month. Spring tides, where the high tides are higher and the low tides are lower, occur when the gravitational forces of the Moon and the Sun align, enhancing their combined effect. Neap tides, where the high tides are lower and the low tides are higher, occur when the gravitational forces of the Moon and the Sun are partially offset, resulting in reduced tidal amplitudes.
4. Gravitational Differential Forces: Newton's theory provided a conceptual framework to understand the phenomenon of tidal bulges. Tidal bulges occur due to the gravitational differential forces acting on the Earth's oceans. As the gravitational forces vary across the Earth, the water experiences a net force that leads to the formation of two tidal bulges on opposite sides of the planet, aligned with the Moon's position.
##### 15. The deterministic character of Newtonian mechanics. The notion of the state of a system.
1. Deterministic nature of classical mechanics can be established mathematically. The law F=ma is in the position to determine the future trajectories exactly forever in the future, assuming that the forces of F are known, as well as given exact initial position and velocity of a particle. An exception to the deterministic nature of classical mechanics is the actuality of chaotic systems, which are characterized by their sensitivity regarding changes to the initial conditions of the system. 
##### 16. Ontological determinism and epistemological determinism.
1. Ontological determinism: the state of a physical system at a given moment t uniquely specifies the states at any later moment.
		The state is given by position and instantaneous velocity (plus external forces!). 
2. Epistemological determinism (predictability): if we know the initial state of a system, and all the forces and the appropriate laws, then we can predict (with arbitrary accuracy) the future states of the system.
##### 17. Possible challenges to the deterministic character of classical mechanics (two counterexamples plus deterministic chaos).
1. The Norton dome - elegant example of apparent violation of determinism in classical physics has been created by John Norton (2003). As illustrated in Figure 4, imagine a ball sitting at the apex of a frictionless dome whose equation is specified as a function of radial distance from the apex point.
2. The ‘space invaders’ - Velocity becoming in effect infinite in a finite time. By the time t = t*, the object has literally disappeared from the world—its world-line never reaches the t = t* surface. The “escape to infinity,” while disturbing, does not yet look like a violation of determinism. But now recall that classical mechanics is time-symmetric: any model has a time-inverse, which is also a consistent model of the theory. The time-inverse of our escaping body is playfully called a “space invader.”
3. Deterministic chaos - 
##### 18. The notion of a frame of reference and transformations of coordinate systems.
1. A frame of reference is a set of fixed objects that enable us to measure relative distances and times. Usually given in the form of rigid rods connected at a given point and perpendicular to each other (a Cartesian coordinate system). To that we add a set of synchronized clocks distributed in space.
##### 19. The Galilean transformation and the Galilean invariants. The absolute character of time and (momentary) space in classical mechanics.
	t′ = t
    x′ = x – vt 
Galilean transformation (between frames of reference that move uniformly with respect to one another).
	t is an invariant. Thus time is absolute in this sense (the same in all Galilean frames of reference).
    Is space similarly invariant? It depends on how we understand space.
##### 20. Newton's bucket argument for absolute space and Mach's response. The Leibniz shift argument and the principle of sufficient reason.
1. The bucket and water at rest. The surface of the water flat.
2. The bucket rotates, the water at rest. The surface of the water flat.
3. The bucket and the water rotate. The surface of the water concave.
4. The bucket at rest, the water rotates. The surface of the water concave.
    
 the relative motion of the bucket with respect to the water is not enough. We have to know which one is “truly” rotating and which one is “truly” at rest. This can be done only with respect to absolute space.
 
- Mach’s response to Newton’s argument: the inertial effects may be due to acceleration with respect to the ‘fixed stars’.
- The Leibniz shift argument, also known as the identity of indiscernibles, is a principle proposed by Leibniz that deals with the notion of identity. According to Leibniz, if two entities share all the same properties and cannot be discerned from each other, then they are identical. In other words, if two things are indistinguishable in every possible way, they must be one and the same thing.
- The principle of sufficient reason, formulated by Leibniz, states that everything must have a sufficient reason or explanation for its existence, its occurrence, or any fact about it. According to this principle, nothing simply happens without a cause or a reason that can account for it.
##### 21. The difference between absolutism and relationism regarding space and time.
1. Absolutism = substantivalism
2. Relationism: spatial and temporal relations are fundamentally relations between physical objects, not spatiotemporal points. Points are derivative from material objects and don’t exist without them.
	If space and time are absolute in the metaphysical sense (independent from material objects), then they must be absolute in the physical sense (independent from frames of reference). But not in the opposite direction.
    Time and space can be the same in any frame of reference, but they can still be relational, not substance-like.
##### 22. Alternative formulations of classical Newtonian mechanics. The extremal principles. The principle of least action and teleological explanations in physics.
1. Expanding the range of applicability:
	rigid bodies with non-negligible dimensions (rotations),
	continuous media (non-rigid) and fluid mechanics (incompressible fluids, flows),
	constrained motions.
2. Expanding the conceptual framework and formal methods:
	conservation principles (energy, momentum, angular momentum) and their connection with symmetries (Noether’s theorem),
    generalization of the laws of dynamics for the case of rotations (torque, moment of inertia, angular momentum),
    new mathematical techniques (variational principles, generalized coordinates, phase space).
    Fermat’s observation in optics that light “chooses” the path which minimalizes its time travel (this explains the laws of reflection and refraction).
##### 23. Hamiltonian mechanics. The notion of a phase space. Trajectories and velocities in phase space.
1. We start we a set of (generalized) spatial coordinates xi – they may be ordinary, Cartesian ones, or any other. We define corresponding momenta pi (velocity times mass). We treat xi and pi as if they were independent parameters.

Then we find a function H(xi, pi) that represents the total energy of the system. It’s called a Hamiltonian.

2. All motions of bodies occur in physical space which is mathematically represented by coordinates xi. 
    
If we add to this space independent dimensions representing components of momentum pi, we’ll obtain an abstract space called phase space. This space is typically 6-dimensional (3 dimensions of position and 3 of momentum). A point in this space represents a complete state of a body at a given moment. A continuous line represents its trajectory.
##### 24. Calorimetry. The difference between heat and temperature. The equivalence of heat and energy. The first law of thermodynamics.
1. We mix substances of different initial temperatures and we want to know the final temperature. 
2. The main principle: the heat given off by the hotter body equals the heat absorbed by the cooler body. 
3. The principle of the conservation of heat (can be justified within the caloric theory where heat transfer is interpreted as the flow of caloric). The change in the heat of a body is proportional to the difference in temperature.

Generalization: the first law of thermodynamics - The heat absorbed by a body and the work done on the body raise the internal energy of the body.
##### 25. Three formulations of the second law of thermodynamics and their connection with the issue of irreversibility.
1. Kelvin’s formulation: there is no process whose sole result would be to transform heat extracted from a body into mechanical work. The irreversibility stems from the fact that heat energy cannot be completely converted into work without any energy loss.
2. Claussius’ formulation: there is no process whose sole result would be to transfer heat from a colder object to a hotter one. It implies that any process that involves only the conversion of heat into work is irreversible. The irreversibility arises from the fact that heat naturally flows from high-temperature regions to low-temperature regions.
3. Third formulation: In isolated system entropy does not decrease (it increases or stays the same). This formulation connects irreversibility with the concept of entropy, implying that not all states of a system are reachable from a given equilibrium state without entropy generation.

##### 26. The notion of thermodynamic entropy. How do we calculate the difference of entropy between two states of a system?
1. The thermodynamic entropy, denoted as S, is a measure of the disorder or randomness of a system. The entropy of a system is dependent on its macroscopic variables, such as temperature, pressure, and volume.
2. To calculate the difference in entropy between two states of a system, you can use the concept of entropy change, denoted as ΔS. The entropy change is given by the equation:

		ΔS = S_final - S_initial
##### 26. The main assumptions of statistical mechanics. The notions of a microstate and macrostate.
1. A macrostate: a global characteristic of a system given with the help of macroscopic parameters (pressure, temperature, volume, density).
2. A microstate: a complete characteristic of the states of all individual particles (their positions and momenta/velocities at any moment).

 Any given microstate uniquely determines a macrostate.
    However, a macrostate does not uniquely determine an underlying microstate. There is a huge number of distinct microstates that jointly define the same macrostate. Macrostates are groups (clusters) of microstates. Representation in phase space. It is important to remember that we will never know the exact microstate the system is in. But its macrostate can be determined.
##### 27. The reduction of thermodynamics to statistical mechanics.
1. Step 1. We define macroscopic thermodynamic parameters with the help of microscopic properties (using the notions of averages etc., hence the statistical character of reduction).
2. Step 2. We ‘translate’ the laws of thermodynamics (for instance the law of ideal gases) into the language of microstates, and we derive these laws from more fundamental laws of mechanics.
##### 28. The problem of the irreversibility of the second law and the reversibility of Newtonian mechanics. Maxwell's demon and Loschmidt's objection.
1. Maxwell's Demon: Maxwell's demon is a thought experiment proposed by physicist James Clerk Maxwell in 1867. The demon is a hypothetical being that can observe and selectively open or close a small door in a partition between two chambers containing gas molecules. By doing so, it could allow only fast-moving molecules to pass from one chamber to the other, while keeping slow-moving molecules confined. This would lead to a concentration of high-energy (fast) molecules in one chamber and low-energy (slow) molecules in the other, resulting in a decrease in entropy and the creation of a temperature gradient.
2. Maxwell's demon seems to violate the second law of thermodynamics by seemingly creating a perpetual motion machine of the second kind, extracting useful work without any energy input. However, the paradox is resolved by considering that the demon itself must expend energy to observe and manipulate the particles, thus increasing the total entropy of the system, consistent with the second law.
3. Loschmidt's Objection: Loschmidt's objection, named after physicist Josef Loschmidt, challenges the irreversibility of processes described by the second law. Loschmidt argued that if the microscopic laws of motion are time-reversible (as in classical Newtonian mechanics), then the macroscopic behavior described by statistical mechanics should also be reversible. In other words, if the motion of individual particles is governed by equations that are symmetric in time, why do we observe irreversible processes in macroscopic systems?
4. The resolution to Loschmidt's objection lies in the realization that even though the microscopic laws of motion are time-reversible, the behavior of large systems with a large number of particles is governed by statistical probabilities. The increase in entropy and irreversibility arise due to the overwhelming number of possible microscopic states corresponding to a particular macroscopic state. While it is possible to go from an ordered state to a disordered state in a macroscopic system (increase in entropy), the reverse process is extremely unlikely due to the vast number of possible disordered states.

Therefore, while individual particle interactions in classical mechanics are reversible, the statistical behavior of macroscopic systems, governed by thermodynamics, is inherently irreversible due to the overwhelming probability of entropy-increasing processes.
##### 29. Boltzmann's statistical argument for the second law. The statistical notion of entropy.
1. This argument uses the concept of a phase space: the space of positions and momenta for all particles. The phase space is divided into cells, each of which corresponds to one macrostate. Each point in phase space represents one microstate.
##### 30. The difficulties of Boltzmann's approach and his fluctuation hypothesis. The Past Hypothesis.
1. We live in an unusually improbable phase of the universe when entropy is relatively low.
2. The currently accepted age of the universe is too short for a necessary fluctuation to occur. (But what if the current period after the Big Bang was preceded by eons of existence?)
3. The statistical considerations show that it is overwhelmingly probable that we are at the lowest point of entropy now. But this would mean that our past had higher entropy, and therefore our evidence (memory, historical traces) are thoroughly deceiving.
##### 31. The notions of electric and magnetic fields. Arguments for the reality of fields.
1. The ontological problem of the reality of fields (does our fundamental ontology consist of particles only, or particles and fields?)
	1. The abandonment of the mechanistic paradigm. Action at a distance with no direct contact.
	2. The problem of unification. Two distinct phenomena (electricity and magnetism) merged into one. In what sense?
	3. Novel predictions of the theory of electromagnetism. Electromagnetic waves and the problem of the ether.
	4. Conceptual problems that led to the development of an entirely new physics: the Special Theory of Relativity
- Literal interpretation: fields are real entities. They are objects “spread” in space. The strength of a given field characterizes its property at a particular point.
     Other arguments for the reality of fields: they simplify many problems. When we have a field, we can forget about the complicated distribution of charges that create this field.
##### 32. The laws of electromagnetism (Faraday's law, Coulomb's law, Ampere-Maxwell's law, Lorentz force). The relations between electric and magnetic fields.
1. Faraday’s law - The rate of change of the flux of a magnetic field B through a surface S = circulation of an electric field E around the curve surrounding S.
2. Coulomb’s law - The flux of an electric field through a closed surface equals the amount of electric charge inside this surface.
3. Ampere-Maxwell’s law - The flux of electric current through a surface plus the rate of change of the flux through this surface = the circulation of a magnetic field around the curve surrounding the surface.
4. Lorentz force - describes the force experienced by a charged particle moving in an electromagnetic field. It combines the effects of electric and magnetic fields on the charged particle.
##### 33. The sources of magnetism. The non-existence of magnetic charges.
1. There is a law regarding the non-existence of magnetic charges. The flux of a magnetic field through a closed surface is always equal zero.
2. In other words: magnetic field is always sourceless.
##### 34. Intuitive meaning of the flux and circulation of fields.
1. Flux refers to the flow or "amount" of a vector field passing through a given surface. It quantifies how much of the vector field is passing through a specific area. Intuitively, you can think of flux as the number of "field lines" crossing a surface.
		Circulation refers to the tendency of a vector field to circulate or form closed loops around a path or a closed curve. It captures the rotational behavior of the vector field along a closed path. Intuitively, you can think of circulation as the "whirling" or "spin" of a vector field around a closed loop.
1. The flux of an electric field through a closed surface equals the amount of electric charge inside this surface. And the law regarding the non-existence of magnetic charges.
    

1. The flux of a magnetic field through a closed surface is always equal zero. In other words: magnetic field is always sourceless.
	1. The circulation of a field X around a closed curve O: we divide up the curve into small sections of the length dl, and multiply the value dl times the length of the component of X parallel (tangential) to that section. Warning: the direction of the component of X is important (the curve has to be oriented).
	    1. Then we sum (integrate all the values). If the result is zero, the field does not circulate around this curve.
##### 35. The notion of electromagnetic waves and their velocity.
1. They involve the propagation of electric and magnetic fields through space. They are produced by the acceleration or oscillation of charged particles, such as electrons, and are responsible for phenomena such as light, radio waves. 
2. In a vacuum, electromagnetic waves always propagate at the speed of light, denoted by the symbol "c." In the context of classical physics, the speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 299,792,458 meters per second (or about 186,282 miles per second).
3. A wave consists of electric and magnetic fields “propelling” each other through space with no need for material bodies (electric charges).
##### 36. The unification of electricity and magnetism. The description of electric and magnetic phenomena in different frames of reference. Separate electric and magnetic fields are not invariants of transformations between frames of reference.
1. Maxwell’s four laws of electromagnetism show that electric and magnetic phenomena are intricately linked.
2. The laws governing electricity and magnetism are also analogous, except one difference: no magnetic charges. But the connection between electricity and magnetism does not mean that they are one and the same phenomenon.
3. There is an even stronger way to unify these phenomena. It is to show that electricity and magnetism are two aspects of the same reality: an electromagnetic field. This can be done in the special theory of relativity.
##### 37. Two conceptions of the electromagnetic ether. Negative results of the Fizeau and Michelson-Morley experiments. The constancy of the speed of light.
1. Fizeau: The circulation of a field X around a closed curve O: we divide up the curve into small sections of the length dl, and multiply the value dl times the length of the component of X parallel (tangential) to that section. 
	1. Warning: the direction of the component of X is important (the curve has to be oriented). Then we sum (integrate all the values). If the result is zero, the field does not circulate around this curve.
2. Michelson-Morley: The main assumption: the Earth moves with respect to the ether. Consequence: the speed of light measured relative to the Earth should be different in different directions. We send a beam of light to a mirror reflecting it back. We want to calculate the total time of the round-trip journey.
		1. Consider two cases:
    1. The beam of light sent parallel to the direction of motion with respect to the ether.
    2. The beam of light sent perpendicular.
    
3. Rotating this device we should have different times of journey of two beams of light, and therefore we should observe a difference in the interference pattern (a shift of the interference fringes). No such effect was observed. It seems that the speed of light is the same in all directions.
##### 38. The relativity of simultaneity. The meaning of the Lorentz transformations. Time dilation and length contraction.
1. In classical mechanics it is assumed without much argument that we can decide when two distant events are simultaneous. But Einstein pointed out that this is not so simple. 
	1. Direct observation is of no use, because of the delay of light signals. Events that are far away (like supernovae’s explosions) happened much earlier than the time when they are observed by us.
2. Time Dilation: According to the Lorentz transformations, as an object moves relative to an observer at a significant fraction of the speed of light, time intervals experienced by the moving object appear to dilate or slow down from the perspective of the stationary observer. This means that a clock in motion will tick slower compared to an identical clock at rest relative to the observer.
	1. Length Contraction: The Lorentz transformations also predict that objects in motion will appear to contract along their direction of motion from the perspective of a stationary observer. This effect is known as length contraction or Lorentz contraction.
##### 39. The notion of relativistic spacetime. The spatiotemporal interval. The invariant spatiotemporal relations between events (space-like separation, time-like separation, null separation). Light cones, absolute past and absolute future.
1. In the framework of special relativity, the notion of relativistic spacetime combines space and time into a four-dimensional continuum called spacetime. It recognizes that space and time are interconnected and cannot be considered separately, as they are relative to the observer's reference frame.
2. One of the fundamental concepts in relativistic spacetime is the spatiotemporal interval, which measures the separation between two events in spacetime.

1. Space-like Separation: If Δs^2 is negative, the events are said to be space-like separated. In this case, there is no causal relationship between the events, and different observers may disagree on the order of occurrence.
2. Time-like Separation: If Δs^2 is positive, the events are said to be time-like separated. In this case, there exists a causal relationship between the events, and the order of occurrence is preserved for all observers.
3. Null Separation: If Δs^2 is zero, the events are said to be null separated. In this case, the events lie on a light-like path or the world line of a massless particle, such as a photon. The spatiotemporal interval between two events along a light-like path is always zero.

- A light cone shows the possible paths of light and the absolute past and absolute future for an event. The light cone is divided into two regions: the future light cone, representing events that can be causally influenced by the event, and the past light cone, representing events that can causally influence the event.
##### 40. Einstein's equivalence principle. Geometric explanation of the forces of gravity. The concept of curved spacetime and geodesics.
1. A non-inertial frame of reference with no gravity is locally indistinguishable from an inertial frame of reference with gravity.
		Example: An accelerating rocket with acceleration a = g and the same rocket standing on the surface of the Earth.
2. It is also possible to “turn off” gravity by switching to a frame that is in free fall (such as a falling elevator)
All this is possible because gravitational mass is equal to inertial mass.
3. Objects in gravitational fields follow the “shortest” paths (they are called geodesics). But massive bodies present nearby make the spacetime curve, so the geodesics are no longer straight.
##### 41. The relation between physical fields (matter, energy) and the curvature of spacetime. Black holes.
1. The main equation of the General Theory of Relativity: the field equation.

It connects the physical fields (the distribution of mass and energy) with the geometrical features of spacetime (curvature).

1. Physical fields = curvature

2. The greater the masses are, the greater the curvature. 

3. The extreme case: black holes. The curvature is so strong that even light can’t escape it. The event horizon.
##### 42. Experimental confirmations of General Relativity.
1. Einstein’s principle of equivalence:
	1. A non-inertial frame of reference with no gravity is locally indistinguishable from an inertial frame of reference with gravity.    
		1. Example: An accelerating rocket with acceleration a = g and the same rocket standing on the surface of the Earth.
1. It is also possible to “turn off” gravity by switching to a frame that is in free fall (such as a falling elevator)
2. All this is possible because gravitational mass is equal to inertial mass.
