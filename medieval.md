##### 1. 4/5th century, Augustine: what is the source of doubt about the reality of time? *5, “Augustine on Time” + the reading – Confessions, book 11*
- Augustine claims that before creation of heaven and Earth there was no such thing as time and without time there cannot be a change. Time consists of the past, present and future. However, the past is no longer and the future is yet to come. The concern about time is related to the possibility of measuring time, existence of short and long times (e.g. ten days and one thousand years) in past and future (which do not exist, so they cannot be short or long). Augustine gives an explanation of this concern by claiming that the time is really only in the mind.

##### 2. What is the way in which the past and the future might be said to exist? *5, “Augustine on Time” + the reading – Confessions, book 11
- The past and future might be said to exist in different ways than the present does. The past is said to exist in the memory. When we remember a moment from the past, we are mentally present in the present moment, recollecting and remembering the event that has already occurred. The future is said to exist as the anticipation, expectation of the events that will occur. An individual is aware of the passage of time and the movement from the present to the future, which exists as potentiality. 

##### 3. What is the source of knowledge for Augustine? Difference between Plato and Augustine *4, “Augustine on Scepticism, Faith, and Knowledge”
- Augustine was a philosopher tightly tied to the Christian faith. So, the source of knowledge was believed by him to be related to the Christian teachings and the Bible. 
	While Plato’s metaphysics is centered around the ideal forms, which were unchanging and truly real, Augustine focused on the existence of God and divine nature as the source of being and reality. Plato also emphasized the role of rationality and reason while obtaining knowledge, Augustine sees knowledge as related to faith and grace of God, making it inseparable from it.
##### 4. The triad of faculties in the souls (memory, intellect, will) as the image of the Trinity *7, “Augustine on the Will”
- Memory - the ability to think (consider) thoughts of all kinds. Faculty of memory is associated with the Father of the Trinity. Memory is said to be the storage and source of knowledge, holding impressions of past events and providing a foundation for understanding.
- Intellect - the ability to assent to theoretical thoughts as true. Faculty of intellect is associated with the Son of the Trinity. Intellect is said to be the rational and reflective part of the soul, allowing reasoning and contemplation.
- Will - the ability to consent to thoughts as plans of actions. Faculty of will is associated with the Holy Spirit of the Trinity. It serves as a transformative power that moves an individual toward righteousness. By the faculty of will, human can choose and desire.
	As the Trinity, those faculties are in relationship with each other.
##### 5. Augustine’s argument for uncaused acts of evil will *7, “Augustine on the Will”
- Augustine presents an argument concerning the existence of uncaused acts of evil will by focusing on the problem of evil and the nature of freedom. He claims that the human soul has the capacity to act freely, asserting that the God could not be the cause of evil. Evil actions then are an effect of the misuse of freedom by the will.

##### 1. Evil is only a ……… of good. What is Manichaeism? *9, “The God of Augustine”
- Manichaeism is a philosophical system that influenced Augustine’s early thought. It presented a dualistic worldview consisting of two principles: light (good) and darkness (evil). The material world was seen as inherently evil, while the spiritual one was seen as good and light. However, in “The God of Augustine” he refutes the teachings of this doctrine and coins his more nuanced view of the evil and the nature of God, developed through Christian theology.
##### 7. Augustine on freedom, original sin, grace, and predestination, as opposed to Pelagius and Pelagianism *9, “The God of Augustine” (+ 1, “Augustine , on History”)
- In opposition to Pelagius, Augustine argued that human freedom is deeply impacted by the original sin, as by Adam and Eve human nature became corrupted, and humanity lost the ability to choose and act perfectly according to God’s will. Pelagius emphasized human free will without being hindered by original sin.
- Original sin was emphasized by Augustine as the inherited guilt and corruption of human nature. Augustine believed that this sin affected all of humanity, making every person born into a state of sin and separation of God. Pelagius denied the doctrine of original sin, claiming that no person is born with the stain of sin.
- Augustine emphasized the necessity of divine grace for human salvation. However, individuals cannot attain salvation through their own merits or good work due to the fallen nature for human salvation. On the other hand, Pelagius placed greater emphasis on human effort and moral striving, suggesting that individuals can achieve righteousness through their own moral actions.
- Augustine developed a doctrine of predestination holding that God, in his omniscience, predestines certain individuals for salvation. However, Pelagius rejected the idea of predestination, emphasizing the role of human free will in salvation.  Individuals had the ability to choose or reject God.
##### 8. 5/6th century – Boethius as the bridge between ancient and medieval philosophy *1, “Consolations of Boethius”
- Boethius was bridging the gap between ancient and medieval philosophy by blending classical philosophy and Christian thought. In this work, he is engaged in a dialogue with Lady Philosophy, who serves as his guide, providing him with solace and wisdom. Boethius takes from classical philosophy by incorporating concepts such as the eternal nature of truth, the pursuit of virtue, the divine order. He connects them with Christian concepts such as divine providence, importance of faith, notion of God’s transcendence.
##### 9. Boethius’ solution to the problem of divine foreknowledge *9, “Boethius on Divine Foreknowledge” + the reading – The Consolation of Philosophy, book 5
- Divine foreknowledge is a concept of omniscient God knowing the future events, argued by Boethius. For him, it does not determine or influence human actions. He proposes a solution to the problem of divine foreknowledge and human free will by introducing the concept of divine eternity. Boethius claims that God’s timeless knowledge is not causally linked to human choices and actions but stems from His comprehensive awareness of all things. Human beings maintain their freedom and responsibility for their choices, even though God possesses foreknowledge of those choices.
##### 10. Boethius’ Neoplatonic understanding of eternity *9, “Boethius on Divine Foreknowledge” + the reading – The Consolation of Philosophy, book 5
- Boethius's Neoplatonic understanding of eternity posits that God's knowledge is timeless and unchanging. It allows him to reconcile divine foreknowledge with human free will. Since God's knowledge is eternal and not dependent on temporal progression, it does not predetermine or influence human choices. It transcends the temporal order and provides a comprehensive awareness of all events. This understanding allows Boethius to reconcile divine foreknowledge with human free will, as God's eternal knowledge does not interfere with human choices made within the temporal realm.
##### 11. John Philoponus’ critique of Aristotelian physics, e.g. the sempiternity of the world, projectile motion *5, “Philoponus, Critic of Aristotle” (+ 1, “The Greek Philosophy…”)
- Philoponus' major critique was directed at Aristotle's concept of the sempiternity of the world, which posited that the universe had always existed and would continue to exist indefinitely without a beginning or an end. Philoponus rejected this idea and argued for a different view known as "creation ex nihilo," which posited that the universe had a specific moment of origin brought about by a divine creator. Philoponus' critique of Aristotelian physics extended to the concept of projectile motion as well. According to Aristotle, objects in motion required a continuous external force to sustain their motion. Philoponus challenged this notion and proposed that objects could be set in motion by an initial force but would continue to move without any external influence, moving naturally due to their inherent properties. This anticipation of inertia laid the groundwork for later developments in the understanding of motion.
##### 12. 9th century: John Scotus Eriugena: the fourfold division of Nature *1, “Philosophy in the Carolingian Empire”*
- Nature that creates and is not created: This aspect refers to God, the ultimate source of all existence. According to Eriugena, God is the cause of all things and is uncreated and eternal. God is the highest level of reality and transcends all categories and divisions.
- Nature that is created and creates: This division includes the divine ideas or the primordial causes through which God brings forth the created world. Eriugena posited that these divine ideas exist in God's mind and serve as archetypes for the entire created order. They are the patterns or forms from which all things are derived.
- Nature that is created and does not create: This aspect encompasses the entire visible and tangible world of created beings, including the physical universe, living organisms, and human beings. These created beings derive their existence and characteristics from the divine ideas and participate in the creative process, but they do not possess the power of creating in the same way as God.
- Nature that neither creates nor is created: This division refers to the realm of non-being or nothingness. It represents the absence or negation of being and exists as a contrast to the other divisions of nature. Eriugena considers it as a necessary complement to the totality of existence, highlighting the contrast between the finite and the infinite, the created and the uncreated.
##### 13. Eriugena’s and Maimonides’ negative theology. E.g. what are we really saying, according to Maimonides, when we say “God is wise”? *1, “Philosophy in the Carolingian Empire”, “Maimonides”*
- Both Eriugena and Maimonides engaged with negative theology, a philosophical approach that emphasizes the limitations of human language and understanding when discussing the nature of God. They recognized that human language and concepts fall short in fully capturing the essence of the divine and therefore employed negative or apophatic theology to approach this subject. He suggested that when we ascribe attributes or qualities to God, such as saying "God is wise," we are not asserting that God possesses wisdom as we understand it in human terms. Instead, such statements are meant to express a negation of the opposite attribute. In this case, saying "God is wise" means that God is not ignorant or lacking in wisdom.
##### 14. Al-Kindi’s arguments for the finitude of the world in time and space *9, “Islamic Arguments for God’s Existence”
- Argument for the finitude of the world in time: Al-Kindi argued that the world must have a beginning in time. He posited that an infinite amount of time cannot exist because an actual infinite is impossible. He supported this view by stating that an actual infinite leads to paradoxes and contradictions. For example, if an infinite number of past moments in time had already occurred, it would be impossible to reach the present moment. Therefore, Al-Kindi concluded that the world must have a temporal beginning and is finite in time.
- Argument for the finitude of the world in space: Al-Kindi also presented an argument for the finitude of the world in space. He argued that if the world were infinite in its spatial extent, then it would contain an infinite number of bodies, which he believed to be logically untenable. He asserted that an infinite number of bodies would result in an infinite amount of matter, and this would lead to contradictions and absurdities. For instance, if the number of particles were infinite, then the sum of all particles would be infinite, which is impossible. Therefore, Al-Kindi concluded that the world must be finite in its spatial extent.
##### 15. 10th century: Al-Farabi’s interpretation of the Aristotelian agent intellect as the tenth intelligence and Avicenna’s modifications *1, “Muslim and Jewish Philosophers”; 7, “The Agent Intellect in Islamic Thought”* 
- Al-Farabi identified the agent intellect as the tenth intelligence, which he believed was a separate entity beyond the celestial spheres. According to him, this tenth intelligence acted as a mediator between the celestial intelligences and the human intellects. It transmitted knowledge and spiritual influences from the celestial realm to the human realm, facilitating human understanding and intellectual development.
- Avicenna introduced the concept of the Active Intellect, which he distinguished from the agent intellect. According to Avicenna, the Active Intellect is the source of intellectual illumination and is responsible for illuminating the potential intellect in humans. It is a transcendent and immaterial entity that facilitates human understanding and knowledge acquisition.
##### 16. The differences between the two schools of kalam, Mutazilites and Asharites (presentation) 
- Kalam – Mutazilites
	- Rejection of ‘divine command’ theory of justice
	- it is not up to God to decide what constitutes justice: God performs justice because it is just, not vice versa 
	- human reason is capable of discriminating good from evil
	- moral responsibility requires genuine freedom
	- the principle of alternative possibilities (PAP)
	- God’s unity (tawḥīd) vs divine attributes
	- God’s knowledge = God himself (Abū l-Hudhayl)
	- attributes of essence / attributes of action
	- negative theology: divine attributes are concealed negations, ‘God is knowing’ = ‘God is not ignorant’

- 🡪 Maimonides (12th cent.) 
- Kalam – Asharites
	- Nature of justice is determined by God’s choice
	- in Latin Europe – cf. Duns Scotus and Ockham (14th c.)
	- Acquisition doctrine: God creates our actions, but we ‘acquire’ them and thus take upon us the responsibility
	- Divine attributes are distinct from God (against unity)
	- Ashʿarism = reverse Mutasilism?
	- No – e.g., common metaphysics: created substances are atoms (indivisible particles) to which God joins accidental properties. Substances are preserved in existence moment-to-moment by divine power
	- But – Asharites: God may join attributes to substances however he wishes (voluntarism)
	- so long as he doesn’t violate the law of non-contradiction…
##### 17. 11th century: Avicenna: the argument for the existence of the Necessary Existent (wajib al-wujud) *1, “Avicenna and His Successors”; 6, “Avicenna on Being, Essence, and Existence”*
- One of his central philosophical arguments is the proof for the existence of the Necessary Existent, known as "wajib al-wujud" in Arabic. This argument is a cornerstone of Avicenna's metaphysical system and is based on the distinction between essence and existence.

- Avicenna's argument for the Necessary Existent can be summarized as follows:
	- The distinction between essence and existence: Avicenna posited that existence and essence are distinct concepts. Essence refers to the nature or quiddity of a thing, while existence is the actual being or reality of that thing. According to Avicenna, existence is a separate and necessary attribute that needs to be added to the essence of a thing for it to exist.
    
- The contingency of existents: Avicenna argued that all existents in the world, including individual objects and beings, are contingent in nature. This means that their existence is not necessary or self-contained within their own essence. They depend on something else for their existence.
- The hierarchical chain of existence: Avicenna proposed that there must be a necessary existent, a being whose essence and existence are one and the same. This Necessary Existent is not contingent and does not depend on anything else for its existence. It is the ultimate source of existence for all other contingent beings in the world.
- The proof for the Necessary Existent: Avicenna's proof for the existence of the Necessary Existent, based on the distinction between essence and existence and the contingency of existents, is a form of the cosmological argument. He argued that if everything in the world were contingent and dependent on something else for its existence, there would be an infinite regress of causes and explanations. This would lead to logical absurdity. Therefore, Avicenna concluded that there must be a necessary existent that is the cause of the existence of all contingent beings.
##### 18. Avicenna’s distinction between essence (quiddity) and existence *1, “Avicenna and His Successors”; 6, “Avicenna on Being, Essence, and Existence”*
- Essence (Quiddity): Essence refers to the nature or quiddity of a thing. It represents the set of characteristics, properties, and qualities that define what something is. It is the answer to the question, "What is it?" Essence is concerned with the internal structure and attributes that make a thing what it is. It encompasses the necessary and intrinsic features that define the identity and essential properties of an object or being.
- Existence: Existence, on the other hand, refers to the actual being or reality of a thing. It denotes the fact that something exists or has actual existence. Existence is the ontological status of a thing, indicating its presence in reality. It is the answer to the question, "Does it exist?" Existence is the state of being in which an essence manifests and becomes a real entity.
- Avicenna argued that essence and existence are distinct concepts. Essence does not guarantee existence, and existence is not an inherent attribute of essence. According to Avicenna, existence is a separate and necessary attribute that needs to be added to the essence of a thing for it to exist.
##### 19. Avicenna notion of universals, e.g. “horseness” *6, “Avicenna on Being, Essence, and Existence”*
- Universals refer to qualities, properties, or characteristics that are shared by multiple individual objects or entities. They are general concepts or ideas that can be predicated of many particular things. For example, "horseness" is a universal concept that applies to all horses, and it is distinct from individual horses themselves.
- Avicenna maintained that universals have both an essence and an existence. The essence of a universal refers to its conceptual or intellectual nature, the abstract concept or idea that defines it. In the case of "horseness," the essence would involve the defining characteristics that make something a horse.
##### 20. Avicenna’s theory of inner senses *“Avicenna on Intellect and Imagination” + the reading*
- **Common Sense (Hiss Mushtarak)**: According to Avicenna, the common sense is the fundamental inner sense that integrates sensory information from the external senses (such as sight, hearing, touch, etc.). It serves as a central coordinating faculty, allowing us to perceive and make sense of the external world. The common sense also helps in unifying the diverse sensory inputs into a coherent whole.
- **Imagination (Khayal)**: Avicenna considered the imagination as a distinct inner sense that plays a crucial role in mental imagery, memory, and creative thinking. The imagination receives and stores sensory perceptions, forming mental images or representations that can be recalled and manipulated. It allows us to mentally manipulate objects and events, even in their absence.
- **Estimation (Wahm)**: Estimation is an inner sense identified by Avicenna that is closely associated with the emotions and the assessment of value. It involves the evaluation of sensory input and the formation of affective responses. Estimation helps in making quick judgments, assessing the significance or danger of stimuli, and experiencing emotions based on these assessments.
- **Memory (Hafiza)**: Memory is another inner sense described by Avicenna. It is responsible for the retention and recall of past experiences and information. Avicenna believed that memory involves the preservation of mental images or impressions formed through the common sense and imagination. It enables us to retain and retrieve knowledge and past experiences.
- **Common Phantasy (Takhayyul Mushtarak)**: Avicenna proposed the concept of the common phantasy, which he considered as a higher-level inner sense. It involves the combination and manipulation of mental images generated by the imagination. The common phantasy enables complex mental operations, such as abstract thinking, conceptualization, and the formation of judgments.
##### 21. Avicenna’s “Flying Man” argument *“Avicenna on Intellect and Imagination” + the reading]
- Imagine a person who is created as an adult and suspended in mid-air, completely isolated from any sensory input. This person has no access to their physical senses, such as sight, touch, hearing, or any bodily sensations. They are devoid of any external stimuli.
- Despite being deprived of sensory experiences, Avicenna argues that this person would still have self-awareness and knowledge of their existence. This self-awareness arises solely from the operation of the intellect, which is distinct from the senses.
- He contends that self-awareness and knowledge of one's own existence do not depend solely on sensory experiences but can be grasped through the intellectual faculties.
##### 22. Ibn Gabirol’s universal hylomorphism *1, “Avicenna and his Successors”*. What is “spiritual matter”? *1, “Muslim and Jewish Philosophers”, 2, “Bonaventure”* 
- According to Ibn Gabirol's universal hylomorphism, everything in the cosmos is composed of a combination of matter and form. Matter provides the potential for existence and is associated with material bodies, while form gives shape and actualizes the potentiality of matter. However, Ibn Gabirol extended this hylomorphic framework beyond the physical realm to include spiritual or incorporeal entities.
- The term "spiritual matter" is used by Ibn Gabirol to refer to a non-physical, incorporeal substance that exists alongside physical matter. It is distinct from the material matter that comprises the physical world. Ibn Gabirol believed that spiritual matter is a fundamental element in the hierarchical structure of the universe.
##### 23. Can God change the past according to Peter Damiani? Could God create a better world according to Peter Abelard? Why? *9, “Omnipotence in Damiani and Abelard”] 
- Damiani believed that God's power operates in the present and future, but not in the past. He argued that God's omniscience encompasses all moments of time, including past, present, and future, but His power is limited to acting within the present and future.
- According to Abelard, God's power is not bound by the constraints of time or predetermined events. He believed that God could have created a better world if He had chosen to do so. Abelard emphasized the importance of God's freedom in creating and shaping the world, suggesting that there were multiple possible worlds that God could have brought into existence.
##### 24. Reconstruct Anselm of Canterbury’s ontological argument *9, “Anselm’s Proof of God” + the reading – Proslogion] 
- Definition of God: Anselm begins by defining God as "that than which nothing greater can be conceived." He argues that this concept of God includes all possible perfections and qualities.
- The Concept of God in the Mind: Anselm suggests that the concept of God exists in the mind. Even if someone does not believe in the actual existence of God, they can still understand the concept of God as the greatest conceivable being.
- Existence in Reality: Anselm claims that existence in reality is greater than existence solely in the mind. He argues that a being that exists in reality is greater than a being that exists only as a concept or idea in the mind.
- The Fool's Objection: Anselm anticipates an objection that someone may raise, which is often referred to as the "fool's objection." The objection questions the move from the concept of God in the mind to the existence of God in reality. The objector claims that they can conceive of something greater than God, namely, a being that exists both in the mind and in reality.
- Anselm's Response: Anselm responds to the fool's objection by arguing that if such a being existed, it would still be encompassed within the concept of God as "that than which nothing greater can be conceived." In other words, the objector's claim simply reinforces the concept of God as the greatest conceivable being.
- The Necessary Being: Anselm concludes that if we accept the definition of God as the greatest conceivable being, then God must exist necessarily. He argues that it is logically impossible for the greatest conceivable being not to exist because existence is a necessary attribute of such a being.

In summary, Anselm's ontological argument presents the idea that God, defined as the greatest conceivable being, must exist necessarily. He argues that the concept of God in the mind implies existence in reality because existence in reality is greater than existence solely in the mind. Anselm responds to objections and asserts that the greatest conceivable being must exist necessarily. The argument is a reflection on the nature of God and the concept of perfection.
##### 25. Point out the weaknesses of Anselm’s ontological argument *as above*
- Reliance on the definition of God: Anselm's argument heavily relies on defining God as "that than which nothing greater can be conceived." Critics argue that this definition is subjective and assumes that all individuals share the same understanding and concept of God. However, there are diverse conceptions of God, and not everyone would agree with Anselm's definition.
- Existence as a predicate: Anselm treats existence as a property or predicate of a being, arguing that existence in reality is greater than existence solely in the mind. Critics, including Immanuel Kant, have argued that existence is not a predicate that adds value or greatness to a being. Existence is not a characteristic that can be attributed as a quality or attribute of something, but rather a condition of its actuality.
- The "fool's objection" and circularity: Anselm's response to the "fool's objection" has been criticized for being circular. He argues that a being that exists both in the mind and in reality is still encompassed within the concept of God. However, critics contend that this response assumes the existence of God to prove the existence of God, thus making the argument circular and begging the question.
- Limited scope: Anselm's argument is limited in its scope as it relies solely on a priori reasoning and conceptual analysis. It does not consider empirical evidence or the complexities of the physical world. Critics argue that the existence of God cannot be proven solely through conceptual analysis but requires additional evidence or arguments from other domains of inquiry.
- The possibility of non-existence: Anselm's argument assumes that existence is a necessary attribute of the greatest conceivable being. However, critics argue that it is possible to conceive of a being that does not exist but is still considered greater than a being that exists. They challenge the notion that existence is an essential quality for greatness.

##### 26. 12th century: The problem of universals and Abelard’s nominalism *3, “Abelard as Logician” + the presentation]
- The problem of universals deals with the question of whether universal concepts or properties have real existence or are merely mental constructs. Nominalism, as advocated by Abelard, posits that universals are nothing more than names or labels we attribute to particular things based on similarities we observe. Abelard's nominalism and conceptualism offered an alternative perspective on the problem of universals, challenging the prevailing realist accounts. His emphasis on the primacy of particulars and the role of language in shaping our understanding of the world influenced subsequent philosophical discussions on the nature of universals and the relationship between language and thought.
##### 27. What are we responsible for, according to Abelard? Definition of sin *8, “Abelard’s Ethic of Intention” + the reading – Ethics
- According to Abelard, human beings are responsible for their intentions and the choices they make based on those intentions. He emphasized the importance of the will and the moral significance of human actions. He considered sin as a deliberate intention to act against divine law, emphasizing the significance of intentions in moral evaluation. Abelard's ethical framework focused on the internal aspects of morality, such as intentions and dispositions, rather than solely on external actions.
##### 28. What is the relation (1) between sin and deed, (2) between sin and will, and (3) between sin and moral vice *as above*
- Relation between Sin and Deed: According to Abelard, sin primarily resides in the will and intention behind a deed rather than in the external action itself. He emphasized that the moral value of an action depends on the intention and will that motivate it. Abelard recognized that external actions can be influenced by various factors, including external circumstances or constraints, which may diminish or increase moral culpability. Therefore, the sinfulness of a deed is primarily determined by the sinful intention or will driving it.
- Relation between Sin and Will: Abelard considered the will as the central locus of moral responsibility. He believed that individuals have the freedom to choose between good and evil, and their intentions and choices flow from their will. Sin, for Abelard, resides in the deliberate and conscious choice to act against divine law or God's commandments. The will is responsible for the formation of intentions, and sinful intentions stem from a will that goes against what is morally right. Thus, the will plays a crucial role in the generation of sin.
- Relation between Sin and Moral Vice: Abelard drew a distinction between sin and moral vice. Sin, as previously mentioned, is primarily concerned with the intentional and willful transgression of divine law. Moral vice, on the other hand, refers to the development of dispositions or habits that incline individuals towards sinful actions. Abelard acknowledged that repeated sinful actions can lead to the formation of moral vices or character flaws, which make it easier for individuals to commit sins in the future. In this sense, moral vice is the state of having a disposition or inclination towards sin, while sin refers to the individual sinful acts themselves.
##### 29. Does the actual performance (action) or pleasure add anything to the sin or merit, according to Abelard? Why? *as above
- According to Abelard, the actual performance of an action and the pleasure derived from it do not add anything to the sin or merit of an action in themselves. He emphasized that sin and merit reside primarily in the intention and will behind the action, rather than in the external consequences or the pleasure derived from it.
##### 30. Other twelfth-century philosophers and examples of their views: the so-called School of Chartres, Gilbert of Poitiers *1, “Averroes” + the presentations 
- School of Chartres:
	- Integration of Faith and Reason: The School of Chartres emphasized the compatibility of faith and reason. Scholars at Chartres sought to harmonize Christian theology with the study of the natural world, drawing from sources such as Aristotle and Neoplatonism. They believed that both faith and reason could lead to a deeper understanding of the divine.
	- Emphasis on Natural Philosophy: The scholars of Chartres placed a significant emphasis on the study of natural philosophy, including cosmology, astronomy, and the natural sciences. They believed that studying the natural world could reveal insights into God's creation and the divine order.
	- Symbolism and Allegory: The School of Chartres employed symbolic and allegorical interpretations of texts, including biblical and classical works. They believed that the true meaning of these texts could be accessed through layers of symbolic and metaphorical interpretation.
    
- Gilbert of Poitiers:
    - Realism: Gilbert of Poitiers was known for his realist philosophy, particularly in the domain of metaphysics. He argued for the existence of universals as real entities that exist independently of individual objects. This position contrasted with nominalism, which denied the objective existence of universals.
	- Divine Illumination: Gilbert proposed a theory of divine illumination, which posited that human knowledge and understanding are guided by divine illumination. According to this view, God enlightens the human intellect, enabling individuals to grasp truth and engage in rational inquiry.
	- Trinity and Theology: Gilbert made significant contributions to Trinitarian theology. He developed a theory known as the "psychological analogy," which sought to explain the relationship between the three persons of the Trinity using the analogy of the human mind and its cognitive faculties.
##### 31. Averroes’ theory of the unity of the intellect *7, “Psychology of Averroes” + 1, “Averroes”
- Unity of the Intellect: Averroes argued for the unity of the intellect, which he believed to be a single, shared entity among all human beings. According to his theory, there is a universal, immaterial intellect that transcends individual human minds and is responsible for intellectual activities.
- Active and Passive Intellect: Averroes distinguished between two aspects of the intellect: the active intellect (al-ʿaql al-faʿʿāl) and the passive intellect (al-ʿaql al-maʾlūl). The active intellect is the universal intellect, while the passive intellect is the individual's potential for understanding.
##### 32. Maimonides tried to reconcile Aristotle with Judaism. In what aspects does philosophy need to give way to religion or vice versa? (world’s beginning in time, providence) *1, “Maimonides”
- Maimonides, a Jewish philosopher and theologian, indeed sought to reconcile Aristotelian philosophy with Judaism in his works. Regarding the relationship between philosophy and religion, Maimonides proposed certain aspects where philosophy and religion may need to accommodate each other. Two specific areas where the reconciliation between philosophy and religion is explored are the world's beginning in time and the concept of providence:
- World's Beginning in Time: Aristotle's philosophy posited the eternity of the world, suggesting that the universe had no temporal beginning. However, Maimonides, as a Jewish thinker, adhered to the belief in the creation of the world by God at a specific point in time. To reconcile the two, Maimonides proposed that the belief in the temporal beginning of the world should be accepted based on religious conviction, as it is a fundamental tenet of Jewish faith. In this aspect, philosophy gives way to religious doctrine, acknowledging the primacy of religious teachings in matters of creation.
- Providence: Maimonides also addressed the concept of divine providence, which refers to God's continuous involvement and guidance in the world. While Aristotle's philosophy did not explicitly acknowledge a personal and providential deity, Maimonides affirmed the belief in divine providence as a central tenet of Judaism. Here, Maimonides suggested that philosophical inquiries should give way to religious convictions, recognizing that the realm of divine providence lies in the domain of faith and religious understanding rather than purely philosophical speculation.
##### 33. 13th century: Three innovative impulses of the philosophy in the 13th century? 
- The universities: The university is, in essentials, a thirteenth-century innovation, if by ‘university’ we mean a corporation of people engaged professionally, fulltime, in the teaching and expansion of a corpus of knowledge in various subjects, handing it on to their pupils, with an agreed syllabus, agreed methods of teaching, and agreed professional standards. A typical medieval university consisted of four faculties: the universal undergraduate faculty of arts, and the three higher faculties, linked to professions, of theology, law, and medicine. 
- Aristotelian Revival: The 13th century saw a revival of interest in Aristotle's works. The Latin West, particularly through the efforts of Scholastic thinkers, encountered and assimilated Aristotle's philosophy, which had been largely neglected in the early medieval period. Aristotle's ideas on metaphysics, ethics, natural philosophy, and logic became influential, sparking debates and stimulating new lines of inquiry. The Aristotelian revival led to a profound reshaping of philosophical thought and had a lasting impact on subsequent philosophical developments.
- Franciscan and Dominican Contributions: The 13th century witnessed the rise of the Franciscan and Dominican orders, which made significant contributions to philosophical thought. The Franciscans, led by figures like Bonaventure, emphasized the mystical and intuitive dimensions of knowledge, exploring the union of the soul with God. The Dominicans, represented by thinkers like Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas, pursued a rigorous intellectual approach and engaged in systematic theological and philosophical investigations. The intellectual activities of these orders propelled philosophical discourse, with the Franciscans contributing to mystical and contemplative aspects, while the Dominicans focused on scholastic rigor and the synthesis of faith and reason.
##### 34. The medieval theory of supposition – types of supposition (3, “The Thirteenth-Century Logic of Terms” + the presentation) 
- Natural Supposition: outside of context (a set of items to which a word can be applied, reference determined by lexical meaning / “signification”)
- Simple Supposition: Simple supposition refers to the basic, ordinary use of a term to signify its usual meaning or the objects it normally denotes. It is the straightforward reference of a term to the things it represents. For example, in the sentence "Dogs are animals," the term "dogs" has simple supposition, referring to the actual animals we commonly understand as dogs.
- Material Supposition: Material supposition occurs when a term is used to refer to the concept or term itself rather than to the objects it denotes. It is a kind of supposition that does not directly represent external reality. For example, in the sentence "The word 'cat' has three letters," the term "cat" has material supposition, referring to the term itself rather than the actual feline creature.
- Personal Supposition: Personal supposition refers to the way a term stands for individuals or particular instances of a general concept. It involves the term referring to specific individuals or instances rather than the general concept itself. For example, in the sentence "Socrates is wise," the term "Socrates" has personal supposition, representing the particular individual Socrates and his attribute of being wise.
##### 35. Robert Grosseteste’s theory of light and Bonaventure’s views on illumination *2, “Robert Grosseteste and Albert the Great”, “Bonaventure” (cf. 4, “Bonaventure on Illumination”)
- Robert Grosseteste's Theory of Light: Grosseteste viewed light as a fundamental principle in the order of creation. According to his theory, light was the first form of corporeal substance emanating from God. He believed that light possessed a generative power and served as the foundation for the organization and development of the physical world. In Grosseteste's cosmological framework, light acted as the medium through which divine perfection and intelligibility were communicated to the material universe.
- Bonaventure's Views on Illumination: Bonaventure, a Franciscan theologian, held a philosophical and theological view on illumination that emphasized the role of divine light in human cognition and spiritual growth. He believed that human knowledge and understanding were dependent on the light of divine illumination. According to Bonaventure, God's light illuminated the mind, enabling it to grasp truth and participate in the divine wisdom.
##### 36. The structure of a medieval quaestio (as illustrated by an “article” of Aquinas’ Summa Theologiae) *2, “Thomas Aquinas” + the reading
- A yes-no question, e.g. Does God exist?
- Videtur – “It seems that God does not exist”
- a list of arguments for the position which will be rejected by the author (or at least qualified)
- Sed contra – “But against this…”
- usually a few quotations from authorities
- Respondeo – “I answer…” – author’s analysis and solution
- the “body” (corpus) of the quaestio (determinatio magistralis)
- Replies to the objections from (2) based on (4)
##### 37. Peculiar views of the Latin Averroists and Thomas Aquinas’ critique (eternity of the world, the unity of the human intellect) *2, “Siger of Brabant and Roger Bacon”; 7, “Psychology of Averroes”, “Aquinas on the Senses and Intellect” (cf. 3, “Natural Philosophy…”)
- Eternity of the World: The Latin Averroists, influenced by Averroes, held the view that the world is eternal, without a beginning or end in time. They argued that the eternity of the world was compatible with religious belief and could be reconciled with Christian theology. However, Thomas Aquinas strongly opposed this view. Aquinas argued that the world has a temporal beginning, as affirmed by the Christian doctrine of creation ex nihilo (creation out of nothing). He believed that God, as the ultimate cause, brought the world into existence at a specific point in time.
    
- Unity of the Human Intellect: The Latin Averroists also held a peculiar view regarding the unity of the human intellect. They proposed that there is a single, shared intellect for all human beings, known as the "unitive" or "acquired" intellect. According to this view, individual human minds do not possess personal intellectual capacities but rather participate in this shared intellect. The Latin Averroists argued that this unity of intellect allowed for the possibility of intellectual perfection and the attainment of universal truths. In contrast, Aquinas rejected the notion of a shared intellect and defended the existence of individual, personal intellects. He believed that each human being has a unique intellectual capacity and the ability to acquire knowledge and understand the world as an individual person.
##### 38. Aquinas on cognition: senses, phantasms, intelligible species, potential (receptive) and agent intellect, and their role in concept-formation [7, “Aquinas on the Senses and Intellect”, 4, “Aquinas on Concept-Formation”]
- Senses: According to Aquinas, cognition begins with sensory perception. The senses receive external stimuli and transmit sensory information to the mind. The senses provide us with raw sensory data or impressions of the external world.
- Phantasms: Phantasms, also known as sensory images, are the representations or mental images derived from sensory perception. They are the internal representations of external objects formed by the imagination. Phantasms are crucial in cognition as they serve as the foundation for higher mental processes.
- Intelligible Species: Aquinas posited the existence of intelligible species, which are abstract representations of universal concepts or essences. Intelligible species are not derived directly from sensory experience but are acquired through the active intellect's role in abstraction. These intelligible species allow us to understand and conceptualize the universal aspects of objects or concepts.
- Potential (Receptive) Intellect: Aquinas identified the potential intellect as the faculty of the mind that has the capacity to receive and be informed by intelligible species. The potential intellect is considered receptive and passive, meaning it has the potential to grasp and understand intelligible forms.
- Agent Intellect: The agent intellect, also known as the active intellect, is responsible for abstracting intelligible species from the phantasms and making them available to the potential intellect. The agent intellect is seen as an active and illuminating faculty that enables the potential intellect to understand and form concepts.
- Role in Concept-Formation: Aquinas believed that concept-formation involves a process of abstraction. The agent intellect abstracts universal intelligible species from particular phantasms and presents them to the potential intellect. Through the reception of intelligible species, the potential intellect grasps the universal nature or essence of objects or concepts, allowing for concept-formation and understanding.
##### 39. Aquinas’ views on the human soul as a unique form of body; arguments for its immateriality, subsistence, and immortality *7, “Aquinas on the Will” + the reading
- Immateriality of the Soul: Aquinas argued that the human soul is immaterial, meaning it is not composed of matter. He based this argument on the premise that the soul possesses intellectual capacities, such as the ability to understand universals and engage in abstract thinking. Since these intellectual operations involve grasping immaterial concepts, Aquinas concluded that the soul itself must be immaterial.
- Subsistence of the Soul: Aquinas maintained that the human soul is a subsistent form, capable of existing independently of the body. He argued that the soul's intellectual activities, which are not dependent on bodily functions, demonstrate its independent existence. Aquinas also highlighted the soul's ability to engage in self-reflection and consciousness, which further supports its subsistence.
- Immortality of the Soul: Aquinas put forth several arguments for the immortality of the human soul. One key argument is based on the soul's immateriality and subsistence. Since the soul is not dependent on the body for its existence, it can continue to exist after the body's death. Aquinas also argued that the soul's intellectual nature, its capacity for abstract reasoning and knowledge of universal truths, suggests an intellectual life beyond the limitations of the physical body.
##### 40. Two accounts of the Principle of Individuation – Thomas Aquinas’ (materia signata) and Duns Scotus’ (“thisness”, haecceity) *2, “Duns Scotus”, 6, “The Metaphysics of Duns Scotus”
- Aquinas' Account (Materia Signata): Aquinas argued that matter (materia signata) is the principle that individuates material substances. According to Aquinas, matter is the potential or underlying substratum that allows for the individualization of material objects. It provides the unique determinations and limitations that distinguish one individual from another within the same species. In this view, the specific arrangement and composition of matter contribute to the distinct identity of each individual.
- Scotus' Account (Haecceity): Duns Scotus proposed a different account known as haecceity or "thisness." According to Scotus, what makes an individual distinct is not just its specific matter or form but its unique haecceity. Haecceity refers to the individual essence or the "thisness" of a particular object or entity. It is the principle that makes a specific individual what it is and distinguishes it from all other individuals. Scotus emphasized the irreducible uniqueness and singularity of each individual, which goes beyond their shared characteristics as members of a species.
###### 41. additional: (a) Three modes of being according to Henry of Ghent (esse essentiae, esse existentiae, esse rationis); (b) Peter Olivi’s voluntarism and the notion of active cognition
1.  Esse Essentiae: This mode of being refers to the being of essence. It is the being that belongs to the essence or nature of a thing. It represents the ontological status of what something is. For example, the esse essentiae of a human being would be the being of humanity itself.
	 Esse Existentiae: This mode of being refers to the being of existence. It is the actual existence or concrete being of a particular individual or thing. It represents the ontological status of something actually existing. For example, the esse existentiae of a specific human being would be its individual existence in the world.
	 
	 Esse Rationis: This mode of being refers to the being of reason or being in the mind. It is the being that exists in thought or understanding. It represents the ontological status of something being conceptualized or understood. For example, the esse rationis of a unicorn would be its existence only as a concept or idea in the mind.
	 
1.  According to Olivi, when a person actively directs their attention and will toward an object, they engage in what he called "active cognition" or "cognitio activa." In this view, knowledge is not solely a passive reception of external stimuli but an active engagement with the world.
##### 42. 14th century: What does it mean that “being” – according to Duns Scotus – is univocal, as opposed to being applied analogously? What is his argument for univocity? *2, “Duns Scotus”, 3, “Analogy and Univocity”, (cf. 6, “Metaphysics of Duns Scotus”)
- Univocity of Being: According to Scotus, being is univocal, meaning that the concept of being applies in exactly the same sense to all things that exist. In other words, the term "being" has a single, uniform meaning when applied to different entities. For Scotus, being is a fundamental concept that encompasses both God and creatures, and it is predicated in the same way of all beings.
- Argument for Univocity: Scotus put forth several arguments in support of the univocity of being. One key argument is based on the idea that being is the most basic and fundamental concept. Since being is the most general concept that includes everything that exists, it must have a consistent and univocal meaning. If being were analogical, it would imply that there are different senses or meanings of being, which Scotus found problematic.
##### 43. John Duns Scotus on possibility: (a) potential beings: is there a vacuous space and motionless time? Why? *2, “Duns Scotus”]*, (b) the distinction between “moments of time” and “moments of nature”; the notion of “synchronic” possibility: why are instants of nature ancestors of possible worlds? *6, “The Metaphysics od Duns Scotus”*
1.  Vacuous Space: Scotus rejected the idea of vacuous space, which posits the existence of empty or void spaces in the universe. He held that space is filled with matter or extended entities, and there is no such thing as absolute emptiness or void.
 Motionless Time: Similarly, Scotus denied the notion of motionless time. He believed that time is intrinsically connected to change and motion. Time, for Scotus, is a measure of change or succession and requires some form of activity or movement to exist. Therefore, motionless time would be a contradiction in terms.

2.  Moments of Time and Moments of Nature: Scotus made a distinction between "moments of time" and "moments of nature" in his philosophy. Moments of time refer to the divisions of time measured by clocks or external references. Moments of nature, on the other hand, are the divisions of time based on changes occurring within the natural world itself.
Scotus considered moments of nature to be more fundamental and ontologically significant than moments of time. He argued that moments of nature are the ancestors or precursors of possible worlds. In other words, the changes and variations in the natural world at different moments of nature open up possibilities for different ways the world could have been or could be in the future.

##### 44. Ockham’s Razor and its applications. Which Aristotelian categories did Ockham eliminate and for what reasons? *2, “William Ockham”, 6, “Ockham’s Reductive Programme” + the reading
- Ockham's Razor, also known as the principle of parsimony or simplicity, is a methodological principle attributed to the medieval philosopher William of Ockham. It suggests that when faced with competing explanations or hypotheses, the simplest one should be preferred.

- Applications of Ockham's Razor:
	- Economy of Ontology: Ockham applied his razor to ontological questions, advocating for ontological reductionism. He argued that entities should not be multiplied beyond necessity. In other words, he favored explanations that require fewer entities or assumptions over those that involve unnecessary complexity.
	- Explanation of Natural Phenomena: Ockham's Razor can be applied to scientific explanations. When multiple theories or hypotheses can account for the same observations, the simplest and most straightforward explanation should be favored. This approach helps avoid unnecessary complexities and speculative elements in scientific theories.
	- Elimination of Aristotelian Categories: Ockham challenged several Aristotelian categories, reducing them to a simpler framework. Some of the categories he eliminated or minimized include:
	- Quantity: Ockham rejected the need for a distinct category of quantity. He argued that quantity can be explained in terms of qualities, such as the size or intensity of a quality.
	- Relation: Ockham minimized the category of relation, considering it as a subjective concept rather than an objective reality. He believed that relations exist only in the mind and are not inherent in the objects themselves.
	- Separability: Ockham questioned the idea of substantial forms, which were considered to be separable entities that defined the essence of objects. He argued that forms are not distinct entities but rather patterns or regularities observed in the interactions of objects.
##### 45. Ockham’s nominalism and the notion of mental language *2, “William O.” + presentation*
- William of Ockham was a prominent advocate of nominalism, a philosophical position that rejects the existence of universal essences or natures. Ockham's nominalism is closely related to his theory of mental language.
- Nominalism: Ockham's nominalism holds that only individual things exist in reality. He denied the existence of universal essences or natures that transcend individual objects. According to Ockham, universal terms or concepts, such as "humanity" or "redness," are merely linguistic conventions or mental constructs that help us classify and understand the world. Universals, for Ockham, do not have a real existence independent of individual objects.
- Mental Language: Ockham developed the notion of mental language to explain how we form and manipulate concepts in our minds. He argued that when we think or reason about universals, we use a mental language that is distinct from ordinary spoken or written language. This mental language consists of mental terms or concepts that represent universals or general ideas. In Ockham's view, mental language allows us to form abstract concepts and reason about them. It is a means of organizing our thoughts and understanding the world, even though the universals we think about do not have a real existence. 
- Ockham's theory of mental language supports his nominalistic stance by providing a framework for understanding how we can use general terms and concepts without positing the existence of real universal essences. According to Ockham, our mental language is a product of our cognitive processes rather than a reflection of a preexisting realm of abstract universals.
##### 46. The distinction between intuitive and abstractive cognition in Duns Scotus and Ockham *2, “William Ockham” (+ 4, “The Epistemology of Duns Scotus”, “Intuitive and Abstractive Knowledge in Ockham”)
- Duns Scotus:
	- Intuitive Cognition: For Scotus, intuitive cognition is immediate and direct perception of individual objects or singulars. It involves grasping the particular essence or haecceity of an object, which makes it distinct from all other objects.
	- Abstractive Cognition: Abstractive cognition, according to Scotus, involves extracting or abstracting universal concepts or common natures from intuitive cognition. Through abstraction, we form general ideas that apply to multiple objects of the same kind.
	- Scotus considered intuitive cognition as superior to abstractive cognition because it provides direct access to the individual, concrete reality. He believed that intuitive cognition is necessary for understanding the unique characteristics of each object, while abstractive cognition enables us to grasp common features shared by multiple objects.
    
- William of Ockham:
    - Intuitive Cognition: Ockham used the term "intuitive cognition" differently from Scotus. For Ockham, intuitive cognition refers to direct perceptual awareness of individual objects or sensory experiences. It is the immediate awareness of the external world through the senses.
    - Abstractive Cognition: Ockham's understanding of abstractive cognition is similar to Scotus. It involves extracting general concepts or universal ideas from sensory experiences. Abstractive cognition enables us to form abstract representations that go beyond immediate sensory perception.
    - Unlike Scotus, Ockham did not attribute a special cognitive status or superiority to intuitive cognition. He emphasized the importance of abstractive cognition as the process by which we form general ideas and make knowledge claims about the world.
##### 47. Characteristic elements of Ockham’s ethics, e.g. the divine command theory of moral obligation [8, “The Ethics of Ockham”] 
- (= based on the notion of duty or what is right)

- vs consequentialism (= based on the idea of achieving a good state of affairs)

- ‘Divine command’ metaethics – God could command theft, and it would become obligatory

- God wills x = x is right

- God could even order us to disobey our conscience…

- (‘authoritarian’ ethics), cf. Asharites

- evil = action under obligation to do the opposite

- moral responsibility for acts of will, not for external actions

- the example of changing one’s mind during a suicidal jump
    
- Divine Command Theory: Ockham subscribed to the view that moral obligations are grounded in God's commands. According to him, God's will is the ultimate source of morality, and moral duties are derived from God's commands. Ockham believed that God's commands are necessary for understanding moral obligations and that they establish the basis for distinguishing between right and wrong.
    
- Voluntarism: Ockham's ethics reflect a strong voluntarist perspective, which means that he emphasized the primacy of God's will over reason in matters of morality. For Ockham, moral obligations are not grounded in reason or the inherent nature of things but are dependent on God's arbitrary will. This voluntarist stance places an emphasis on God's absolute power and freedom in determining moral standards.
    
- Individual Conscience: Ockham emphasized the role of individual conscience in moral decision-making. He believed that individuals have a personal obligation to follow their own well-formed consciences. Ockham recognized the importance of individual autonomy and the responsibility of individuals to discern and act according to their moral convictions.
    
- Singular Moral Cases: Ockham placed a significant emphasis on the uniqueness of individual moral cases. He argued that moral principles cannot be universally applied to all situations but should be interpreted and applied in light of specific circumstances. Ockham's focus on singular moral cases underscores the importance of context and practical reasoning in moral decision-making.
    
- Natural Law: Although Ockham is often associated with a nominalist stance, he did not entirely reject the idea of natural law. While he believed that moral principles are ultimately grounded in God's will, he recognized that certain moral principles, such as prohibitions against murder and theft, are discernible through reason and are consistent with natural inclinations.
##### 48. John of Mirecourt’s and Nicholas of Autrecourt’s as precursors of Descartes’ and Hume’s skepticism *2, “The Reception of Ockham”
- Both John of Mirecourt and Nicholas of Autrecourt raised significant challenges to established philosophical and theological doctrines of their time. Their skepticism was aimed at undermining dogmatic claims and encouraging critical examination of knowledge and beliefs. Their ideas laid the groundwork for later philosophers, including Descartes and Hume, who further developed and refined skeptical positions. In summary, John of Mirecourt and Nicholas of Autrecourt can be considered precursors of Descartes' and Hume's skepticism due to their radical doubts and challenges to traditional beliefs. Their skeptical positions paved the way for later philosophers to further explore the limitations of human knowledge, laying the foundations for the development of modern skepticism.
##### 49. “Buridan’s Ass”, “Oxford Calculators” – huh? *2, “The Reception of Ockham”; “The Oxford Calculators”*
- Buridan's Ass: The term "Buridan's Ass" refers to a thought experiment associated with the French philosopher and logician Jean Buridan (c. 14th century). The experiment involves a hypothetical scenario where an ass is placed equidistantly between two equally attractive and appealing bales of hay. The question arises as to which bale of hay the ass will choose to eat from, given that both options are equally desirable. Buridan's Ass illustrates the paradox of rational decision-making when faced with equally balanced options, highlighting the difficulty of making a choice without any determining factor. The thought experiment has been used to explore issues related to free will, determinism, and decision-making processes.
- Oxford Calculators: The Oxford Calculators were a group of scholars associated with the University of Oxford in the 14th century. They were pioneers in the development of medieval mathematical physics, particularly in the field of kinematics. The calculators applied mathematical techniques to investigate the laws of motion and the nature of physical quantities such as time, space, and motion. They made significant contributions to the study of kinematics, refining concepts such as instantaneous speed, uniform acceleration, and the mean speed theorem. 
##### 50. 15th century: According to Nicolas of Cusa (De docta ignorantia), our intellect is related to the truth in the way that a ……… is related to a ……… . What does it mean? *2, “Beyond Paris and Oxford” (cf. 9, “The Informed Ignorance of Nicholas of Cusa”)*
- In "De docta ignorantia," Nicholas of Cusa argues that human intellect is limited and finite, incapable of fully grasping the ultimate truth or understanding the nature of God. He asserts that our intellectual faculties are unable to comprehend the divine essence directly. However, Nicholas proposes that despite this inherent limitation, our intellect can still participate in and relate to the truth in a transformative way. According to Nicholas of Cusa, our intellect can approach the truth through a process of negation and approximation. He suggests that we can gain knowledge of the truth by recognizing what it is not and acknowledging our own ignorance. By acknowledging the limits of our understanding, we open ourselves to a higher level of wisdom, which Nicholas refers to as "learned ignorance."
