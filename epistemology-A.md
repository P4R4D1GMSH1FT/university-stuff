## Narrow Inductivism 
##### 1. How would an ideal scientist proceed according to the narrow inductivist view?
- Ideal scientist would proceed according to narrow inductivist view by (1) getting rid of prejudices by pure observation and innocent uncorrupted eye, theory of idols (2) applying slow and gradual induction 
##### 2. What is the thesis of empiricism?
- The thesis of empiricism says that knowledge derives from experience and must be justified empirically.
##### 3. What role does induction play in an empiricist account of knowledge? 
- Thesis of empiricism, direct (observational) and indirect (non-observational and general) empirical justification and narrow inductivism.
## The Problem of Induction 
##### 4. What is the structure of inductive inferences?
- The inference is inductive when you formulate a general principle from empirically experiencing a case and making a generalization.
##### 5 & 6. What (three) properties do inductive inferences have? ==Which one has been discovered by Hume?==
(1) nondemonstrative - given true premises, conclusion may be false
(2) ampliative - the conclusion contains more information than the premise
==(3) enthymematic - relies on a missing premise==
##### 7. Explain what is meant by the principle of nomological uniformity of nature. 
- Nomological uniformity of nature says that (1) the future will be like the past (2) laws of nature do not change, meaning that if the sun has been rising from the west until this day, you can suppose the sun will also rise from the west the next day.
##### 8. Consider and evaluate the following objection to the principle of nomological uniformity of nature. “The idea that the future will be like the past is ridiculous. I will be old in the future! The future will not be like the past. Hume is just a wishful thinker.” 
---
##### 9. How can one argue that all inductive inferences presuppose the principle of nomological uniformity of nature? 
---  
##### 10. State the problem of induction as a triad of inconsistent propositions.
(1) (All) knowledge is based on experience
(2) (Some) knowledge relies on induction
(3) Induction cannot be justified empirically
##### 11. Explain why Hume thinks that induction cannot be justified empirically. 
- Hume discovered that all inductive reasoning relies on the missing premise that nature is uniform and thinks induction cannot be justified empirically because nomological uniformity of nature cannot be justified so.
##### 12. Evaluate the opinion “The problem of induction is that no matter how much evidence we have gathered to support the claim that all As are B, it can’t be excluded that we will encounter an A that is not B.” 
- Yet, it can be assumed that most As are B if we can observe B in every A in the sample, relying on the assumption that further distribution of that trait will be constant in the rest of the population.
## Wide Inductivism 
##### 13. What is the demarcation problem?
- Demarcation problem concerns the difference between science and pseudoscience, meaning that testing the scientific proposition is possible, which cannot be said about pseudoscience.
##### 14. How does science develop on the narrow inductivist view?
- First, all facts would be observed without selection, then the observed and recorded facts would be analyzed without hypothesis other than those necessarily involved in the logic of thought. Third, from this analysis of the facts generalizations would be inductively drawn as to the relations between them. Fourth, further research would be deductive as well as inductive, employing inferences from previously established generalizations.
##### 15. Explain one of Hempel’s objections to narrow inductivism. 
- Contemporary science would be impossible if it followed Bacon’s path i.e. getting rid of prejudice by pure observation and innocent uncorrupted eye as well as slow, progressive induction, as his idea leads to idealization.
##### 16. Explain Hempel’s objection to the narrow inductivist view that scientists collect relevant facts. (Be sure to explain, and cite an example, relative to what the facts are supposed to be relevant.)
- Hempel’s objection that scientists collect facts relevant to the hypothesis can be seen in the Semmelweis’ case in the Vienna hospital, where the childbirth fever rate in Ward I and Ward II varied a lot. He considered e.g. atmospheric changes, overcrowding and rough student examination in Ward I to be the problem, but the priest and Kolletschka incidents rose a hypothesis about microbes, which led Semmelweis to require hand washing in the hospital, as well as caused Lister to use phenol as antiseptic.
##### 17. Explain the distinction between logic and psychology of discovery? (equivalently using Reichenbach’s terminology – between the context of justification and the context of discovery?) 
- Psychology of discovery (context of justification) consists of ingenuity/intuition/imagination taking a part of general hypothesis, while the said hypothesis and testing, leading to falsification or confirmation and later explanation, prediction and practical application is a logic of discovery (context of discovery).
##### 18. “How do scientists arrive at generalizations/theories?” Explain the narrow and the wide inductivist answer. 
- In the narrow inductivism generalizations are arrived at by looking only at the data, without hypotheses or selection/a priori guess. In the wide inductivism the general hypothesis is withdrawn after the imagination/ingenuity stage.
##### 19. What is the logical structure of (a) confirmation, (b) falsification? 
confirmation is based on inductive reasoning
    H->I
    I
_______
    H

falsification is based on deductive reasoning
	H->I
	~I
______
	~H

##### 20. What is the wide inductivist answer to the problem of demarcation?
- Wide inductivist answer to the problem of demarcation is its criterion - testability, i.e. a hypothesis is scientific if it is in principle testable.
##### 21. How does science develop according to the wide inductivist?
- Scientific development starts with ingenuity, intuition, imagination from which the general hypothesis is withdrawn. Then it is confirmed, based on the inductive reasoning, or falsified, based on the deductive reasoning. If it becomes confirmed, then the explanation of facts, prediction and practical uses occurs.
##### 22. What is reduction? What types of reduction are there?
- Reduction is a process in the progress of scientific development in wide inductionism by accumulation of theories. There is homogeneous reduction, in which theories use the same theoretical language (e.g. they are all coined by physicists), and heterogeneous reduction, in which theories use different theoretical language (e.g. chemistry to physics).
##### 23. What is the postulate of the unity of science?
- Postulate of the unity of science is based on reductionism. The heterogeneous reduction is the process which unifies the science of different branches e.g. chemistry and physics.
##### 24. Explain Reichenbach’s solution to the problem of induction. 
- Reichenbach does not provide empirical justification (it would require empirical justification of uniformity of nature), but pragmatic one.
    
If nature is not uniform and we use induction, we will be failing much of the time. 

If nature is not uniform and we do not use induction, we will fail because we are not even trying to succeed. 

If nature is uniform and we don't use induction, we will fail.

But, if nature is uniform and we use induction, while we will not succeed all the time (inductive inferences are non-demonstrative!), we will succeed much of the time.

##### 25. What is the wide inductivist answer to the problem of demarcation? What are some of the problems with it? 

- Wide inductivist answer to the problem of demarcation is whenever the object of that induction is in principle testable. However, it is not said what it is supposed to mean. The ‘testable’ suggests that the hypothesis is capable of being tested (not whether it has already passed any tests). The addition of ‘in principle’ suggests that we cannot disqualify a hypothesis as unscientific just because we are not yet in the possession of the sort of experimental or conceptual apparatus that would allow us to actually carry out a test.
##### 26. What is the problem of auxiliary hypotheses?
- Auxiliary hypothesis is assumed in order to draw observational consequences in case the hypothesis is not tested itself. The problem is that it cannot really be confirmed (you do not know to what degree the first hypothesis is confirmed) nor falsified (by de Morgan laws, hypothesis is false or auxiliary hypothesis is false or possibly both, but we do not know which is false)
##### 27. Explain the raven’s paradox. 
- Raven’s paradox discovered by Hempel shows that when A is logically equivalent to B then what falsifies A should also falsify B and what confirms A should also confirm B. Law of contraposition shows that “if p then q” and “if not-p then not-q” are logically equivalent. However, when a raven's paradox can be confirmed, it cannot be falsified as “all non-black things are not ravens” can be confirmed by e.g. green grass, white sock.
## Falsificationism 

##### 28. Does Popper agree with Hume that induction cannot be justified empirically? 
- He accepts Hume's thesis as well as his solution to the problem of induction relies on that thesis. He also speaks about establishing induction as epistemologically bankrupt.
##### 29. How does Popper solve the problem of induction?
- Popper solves the problem of induction by getting rid of testing that relies on induction - i.e. confirmation part. He ought to falsify every hypothesis.
##### 30. What should an ideal scientist do according to Popper? And the actual scientist? 
- According to Popper, an ideal scientist should begin by thinking up all possible theories, then falsify as many as they can by testing and single out the one that cannot be falsified. The actual scientist approximates it by proposing as many bold theories as possible and then falsifying them in risky tests.
##### 31. What is the status of unfalsified hypotheses? 
- Unfalsified hypothesis ought to be tested as long as it is falsified or becomes a single unfalsified hypothesis.
##### 32. What is corroboration?
- Corroboration is the measurement of the up-to-date performance of theories based on withstoodment of more risky tests.
##### 33. How does corroboration differ from confirmation?
- While corroboration measures how many and how risky tests a theory has withstood, confirmation measures how probable the theory is.
##### 34. What is the demarcation criterion according to Popper? 
- While inductivists’ demarcation criterion is testability, Popper thinks that non-scientific theories can also undergo testing. He proposes that the demarcation criterion should be falsifiability, because then non-scientific theories become testable yet unfalsifiable. 
##### 35. What is Popper’s view on the development of science? 
- Popper considers good science revolutionary, developing from “lost revolutions”. The bolder theory is falsified, the more progress in science is made.
##### 36. Explain Salmon’s criticism of Popper. 
- Salmon focused on the rationality of prediction. He is concerned about Popper’s thought about non-inductivism of corroboration. Salmon asks why we should pick more corroborated theory over random unfalsified theory, so he criticizes Popper’s idea.
##### 37. What is the problem of auxiliary hypotheses and why is it particularly problematic for Popper? 
- Popper is aware of auxiliary hypotheses and thinks that actual scientists should not reject the hypothesis too early because of the negative result, which might be a fluke or a problem with the instrument and may not repeat in the next testing.
## Kuhn’s Theory of Scientific Development 

##### 38. Explain what Kuhn means by saying that science develops in cycles. 
- Kuhn means that paradigm is a characteristic of science and pre-science does not have it.
##### 39. What phases in a cycle does he distinguish? Characterize them briefly. 
 1. emergence of paradigm (general way of looking at the world)

2. normal science (puzzle solving, research directly)

3. crisis - eventually (and for Kuhn inevitably) scientists encounter anomalies

4. revolution - this is why new paradigms are needed and revolution occurs
##### 40. Why is it impossible to give a non-circular argument for the adequacy of a paradigm, according to Kuhn? 
- Because any scientific argument presupposes a paradigm, it is impossible to give a non-circular argument for the adequacy of the paradigm, because it will also presuppose a paradigm.
##### 41. Does Kuhn believe that science aims at truth? Explain.
- Kuhn does not believe that science aims at truth as he does not believe that science progresses, as well as new paradigms are not more true than old paradigms.
## Nature of Knowledge
##### 1. What is the JTB account? Explain why each of the conditions has been thought to be necessary.
- JTB is a Justified True Belief. It means that a believes that p, (b) p (it is true that p), (c) a’s belief that p, is justified. 
##### 2. Give an example of a belief that is justified inferentially and one that is justified noninferentially. 
###### inferential
- John knows that some animal is on the pole.

(a) John believes that some animal is on the pole.

(b) Some animal is on the pole.

(c) He is justified in his belief (a):

- John sees a bird on the pole.

- John believes that all birds are animals.

###### noninferential
- John knows that a bird is on the pole.
    
  (a) John believes that a bird is on the pole.

   (b) A bird is on the pole.

  (c) John is justified in his belief (a):

- John sees a bird on the pole.
##### 3. Apply the JTB account to a chosen example of ordinary knowledge. 

- John knows that 2+2=4
##### 4. (a) Describe one Gettier-type case. (b) Carefully explain why all the conditions of the JTB account are fulfilled for the case you described in (a). 

-   
##### 5. What is the “no-falsehood condition” response to Gettier? Show how the response applies to (some) Gettier-type cases. 
- According to the “no-falsehood” account, we should attribute knowledge to someone, but we feel that this is not right. Someone’s belief that X is true only by accident. 
##### 6. What is the defeasibility response to Gettier? Show how the response applies to Gettier-type cases.
- Defeasibility response to Gettier means defeating S’s justification for believing that q by p. It can be shown by the example of a clock. S looks at the clock and believes that it is 3pm because the clock shows so. Yet, the clock is not working and it is not 3pm, so even though S believes that q, S’s justification is defeated by that circumstance.
##### 7. Explain Nozick’s account of knowledge. Show how Nozick’s account applies to Gettier-type cases. 
- Nozick coined a condition that if p were not true S would not have believed that and if p were true then S would believe that (truth-tracking). 
##### 8. (a) What is Goldman’s causal theory of knowledge? (b) How is it related to the JTB account of knowledge? (c) How does the theory apply to Gettier-type cases? (d) Explain the barns-façade objection to the account. 
- Goldman proposed the definition that S knows that p iff the fact that p is appropriately causally connected with S's belief that p. There is a combination of (1) p is true (2) S believes that p from JTB in Goldman’s statement. Concerning e.g. Gettier’s sheep case, the S’s forms a belief about sheep in the field while no sheep is involved in that process. His case misses the connection between the subject's belief and the truthmaker.
##### 9. (a) What is Goldman’s reliabilist theory of knowledge? (b) How does the theory apply to Gettier-type cases? (c) How does the theory apply to the barn-façade case? 
- Third condition of his reliabilist theory of knowledge is “S's belief that p was acquired by means of a reliable belief-forming process” when the barn-facade belief is not reliable, as S believes that the barn-facade is real and it is not a reliable belief-forming process.
##### 10. Compare and contrast the reliabilist and the classical account of knowledge. 
- Classical account of knowledge is JTB (Justified True Belief) where (1) S believes that p (2) p is true (3) S is justified in believing so. The reliabilist account of knowledge is “S’s belief that p was acquired by means of reliable belief-forming process”. That means in Gettier’s JTB the belief can arise by any process, e.g. thinking that S owns a Ford just because he drives to work by it, which lowers the reliability of that knowledge. In reliabilist account of knowledge the margin of error is minimized.
##### 11. Compare and contrast the reliabilist and the causal account of knowledge. 
- Goldman’s classical account of knowledge says that S knows that p iff “the fact that p is appropriately causally connected with S's belief that p”. It is a justification condition which includes perception, memory, introspection, reasoning as the connection between S and p. In the reliabilist account of knowledge it is important that S’s belief that p is acquired through a reliable belief-forming process and e.g. memory can be fallible.
##### 12. What is the generality problem? 
- Generality problem is the problem of a reliabilist account of knowledge. In this account of knowledge we need to consider a class of belief-forming processes of a certain type. However, it can be done too wide or too narrow and it is impossible to consider a single process by itself or consider some part of the set of perceptual processes reliable.
##### 13. What is epistemological internalism? What is epistemological externalism? 
- **(Justification-Internalism) If S is justified in believing that p, then S is in a position to know that S is justified in believing that p.**
    
(Truth-Internalism) If p is true then S is in position to know that p is true.

(Belief-Internalism) If S believes that p then S is in a position to know that S believes that p. 

- **(Justification-Externalism) It is possible for S to be justified in believing that p and for S not to be in a position to know that S is justified in believing that p.
    
(Truth-Externalism) It is possible for p to be true and for S to be in no position to know that p is true.

(Belief-Externalism) It is possible for S to believe that p and yet for S not to be in a position to know that S believes that p.
##### 14. What is the demon objection? 
- Demon objection is the situation in which A has its set of beliefs and A’ also has its set of beliefs (the same). While A has the knowledge concerning them, A’ does not have. Yet, they are both equally justified in believing them. It inclines toward internalism.
##### 15. Explain Bonjour’s clairvoyance case. What views on knowledge does it challenge? 
- Bonjour presents a case about a woman, who is an actual clairvoyant and has premonitions about disasters 24h before they happen. She also lives in a jungle and has no confirmation about any events happening. Bonjour raises the question about whether she is justified in believing her premonitions and while internalists does not believe she is justified, externalists think it is reliable enough.
##### 16. Explain two arguments for epistemological internalism. 
- The demon objection is also justified in believing that p, because justification is about how things look from the perspective of the subject.
- Dream is not enough to be justified in believing that p (clairvoyance case example)
##### 17. Explain two arguments for epistemological externalism. 
- Externalism is systemic - could provide responses to many epistemological problems.
- It leaves a room for non-reflective knowledge
##### 18. What is pragmatic encroachment? 
- Pragmatic encroachment covers pragmatic factors as stakes. There are low stakes and high stakes. In low stakes, S supposes that certain things do not change e.g. opening hours of certain institutions. In high stakes it becomes natural to show uncertainty of possessed information.
##### 19. What is the epistemic side-effect effect?
- Using the example of Knobe’s story of chairman intentionally harming/helping the environment, epistemic side-effect is asymmetry in intentional action attributions in these cases, as the chairman has the same state of mind in both cases but received responses concerning epistemological views varied.
